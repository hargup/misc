What are Free and Open Source Softwares?

What is Google Summer of Code

Why Should I contribute?
========================

Last but not the least of the reasons you should contribute to opensource is,
yeah you guessed it right, `$_$`. From better job and work prospectus to direct
compseations like Google Summer of Code there is real money involved in largely
not for profit business of Open Source.

That sounds cool, so how should I get started
=============================================
Well getting started is a little tricky. Most common advise found on the
internet is "find a project you are interested in". Which isn't entirely false
but in its vanila form it is seldom useful. Interest gets build up when you
have been exposed to some particular area aproiry. Because most of the people
in their first and second year are completely knew to the field of computer
science and software engineering. How is a student supposed to be interested in
Compilers when she doesn't even have a good idea of what compilers are.

- What if I'm simply interested in contributing to some opensource software.

- I'm interested in making making money through GSoC tell me a project to do.
  Though this motivation won't get you high regard but it isn't wrong. I don't
  care too much about the intentions to its important the people contribute and
  get to see how things go around in the opensource world.

- Don't choose the project on your current skillset. If you start from now then
  you have at least six months before the application phase, That time frame is
  sufficient to build whatever skill you need to
because doing so it is

First of most people don't know what they are interested in

- If you cannot decide on a project choose one randomly and work on it

How did I got started
---------------------
I got started with SymPy because I found the idea of Computers doing maths,
integration, differentiation etcetra petty intriguing.
I knew about the existance of SymPy from way back in my 2nd Semester. I also
tried fix a "EasyToFix" but then gave up convincing myself I'm good enough. At
around the same time I got meet a few awesome people like Sanjoy Das, Depanjan
Mukharjee, Saurabh Kumar and later Anurag Priyam at KLUG(Khargpur Linux User's
Group) meet.


Parting Advise
==============

- Start as early as possible.
- Ask questions when you need help. Don't be Shy. No question is silly if you
  have made a geniune attempt to find the answer yourself first.
- **Don't take anything personally** If you get a review that your code was not
  good enough it simply means your code wasn't good enough, not that you aren't
  good enough. You should get critism for the code that sucks. People can be
  very blunt pointing that out, but the critism is for the code not for you the
  person.

- **Respect other people's time and Comunicate Effectively** in a medi

- During the application phase don't try to fake your skillset.
- In very rare cases you can ripped into pieces see https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/7233.
In those cases it is better to suck it up and correct yourself.

- **Applying to Multiple organisations**: It is always better to have one good
  application than two mediocre ones. It is better to have one very
  good/excellent application than having two good one. Make sure that you are
  the best person to do that job.
