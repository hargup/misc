 Hey Harsh here

 Hey! How’s it going over there
 Interesting company
 3 Sales Reps, Physical mail marketing company, qualifications based sales, SEO is the main inbound channel.
 Training doesn’t happen very often for them, he thinks the product might be more useful for big companies
 Does he have any pain points?
 Missed directly asking that question. It felt like they a have a very clear target persona and sales motion and it is about doing more of what’s working
 About name: the registation lady didn’t get they name when I told her Altka
 Ah good to know - we can always revisit and continue brainstorming to see what name comes to us
 Ahh yeah I can see that

 He said we can reach out if we think there is a product which can help them. Was kinda excited the prospect of actually being able to speak with the AI
 Nice! I had a feeling there could be something with expensify - that would be a great big name too
 I can also see perhaps our product being integrated into people’s work schedules when they have downtime (if it’s not spent sourcing leads)

 Head of product at a spend management company, he was mostly talking about acquisition of Blue Jeans by Verizon and how they messed it up
 Founder of a services company who make integrations for B2B softwares like Airtable and WorkOS. Most of their sales happen through referral and existing partners, Airtable send them a lot of business.

He was very excited about the potential of getting feedback on existing recordings of sales calls. The idea is that he just want to know how well he did, did he miss asking something they should have asked etc
 This seems to be an appealing wedge - and a way to get data about what’s going on
 Irrespective of whether gong is doing something in the space or not, perhaps there’s room

 They are a outsourcing software development company, fairly big, 3K devs, biggest pain point, the economy
 Cybersecurity company, direct sales don’t work very well because customers don’t want to talk about their security challenges , primary sales channels are investor networks (YC primarily) and referral and some inbound. Biggest paint point: building awareness of the product

 Oh this is a good reminder to ask about their process of closing sales with legal
 Hemant Mohapatra, Partner Lightspeed India. Told him about the idea. Early reaction:
- They recently funded a Microsoft GM, they raised some 20M. Idea: they make calls as BDR and speak like humans, works pretty well. There is a small lag other than that it has do qualification and the person doesn’t feel like they are talking to a AI. Also Cresta, funded by A16Z in 2017. A variant of this idea is the sales training one.
From VC perspective thing to think about what is the differentiation. 
[Note to self, don’t talk to VCs and ignore their advice at this point, can mess up mindset around customer discovery] ‎<This message was edited>

 Forgot to add that talked to the expensify guy and he mentioned that a lot of their structure is that they outsource quite a bit of the teams but that the in company employees kind of manage those. So a bit of vendor management or performance mgmt for vendors maybe? (That could be helpful?)

 Why is it cool? It takes six months to close a deal. And junior guys don’t know how to close. Simulate the there persona, buyer, user and the champion
 Another interesting thing:
- Target industries who are NOT going through a down cycle. SaaS is not doing great right now, but manufacturing and Pharma are not impacted. That what they are focusing on.
 One founder from braindate is in India and they’re looking to hire in US. 2 m arr. self funded bc he previously sold his last company. They do something with SEO optimization and all growth has been from inbound.

 - Raised before product and customers, got customers from investor referrals
 - Suggested reaching out to Series A founders, their training process is not set yet
 And no entrenched software
 Repeated advise that the small companies that will grow with us
 Talked to luzmo sales people (lower level - the head one was on the plane unfortunately. The CEO I met at braindate yesterday) - they showered their sales ramp up info is in notion. Lots of different sections and things for them to refer to. The AE didn’t make it seem helpful at all - I ge the feeling it’s not really and just the product of excessive “operations”. Personally I found it stale and the type of training that is ineffectiv, it’s just a bunch of docs and links. ‎<This message was edited>

 Said that he’s very interested but tbd how much of that was show. He did talk about how the important thing in sales is being able to identify the needs of the customers and if the software helps train junior sales people learn that identifiging customer’s needs / their situation (his example was if someone is inthe dessert and selling them water - the info you need is how long they’ve been there)
 Srini was interested and asking questions around how do we get data to simulate on the customers, because even in the same vertical the customers might behave very very differently.
