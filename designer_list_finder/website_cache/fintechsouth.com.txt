Braindates @ Fintech South







Braindates @ Fintech South



Dedicated time for meetings, each day of Fintech South.
One of the most important aspects of events is engaging with other industry stakeholders to learn, grow your business, and advance your career – but we know your time is valuable and you need to make the most of it. That’s why we’re partnering with Braindate for a powerful new curated meetings program at Fintech South 2023!
What is a braindate?
It is your opportunity to learn from your peers and make the right connections! Braindates are one-on-one or small group conversations based on topics posted by you and fellow participants in the Braindate Topic Market. They can be used to brainstorm, solve challenges, share expertise or experiences while meeting new (brilliant!) people.

Don’t see what you’re looking for? Then post a topic yourself and invite others join a group discussion where you are the host. Haven’t signed up yet? Need some help getting engaged? Then stop by the Braindate check-in desk located just outside the Georgia Ballroom on Level 2 and our expert team will guide you each step of the way.
Here’s what to do:

Log in to the TAG Events App to book your braindates as soon as the Braindate platform is launched in September.
Once Fintech South begins, you’ll connect with your braindates on-site in the Braindate Lounge. Our Learning Concierges will be available to assist you in the Lounge!
