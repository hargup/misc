Don't Be the Latest Statistic!¬† 5 Keys for a Healthy Relationship
 
                                    September

                                    2023 
                                











Contrary to what you might feel, it‚Äôs not too late to save your relationship!
If you're struggling in your relationship, it might be too big of a stretch to remember that honeymoon feeling. Those blissful feelings are often mowed over by conflicts, complaining, and disagreements. Many couples don‚Äôt understand why the strife continues and often feel helpless to stop the vicious cycle. So, unfortunately, they keep digging the hole deeper, having the same arguments over and over.
Some wonder, ‚ÄúHave I fallen out of love?‚Äù or "Why am I failing at love?" Others wonder if they're the only ones with [...]

Why a Growth Mindset for Kids Is the Key to Their Success
 
                                    September
                                    03, 
                                    2023 
                                











In today‚Äôs modern world, how do we inspire children to learn? Why bother when they can just ask Siri or scribble a question into an AI app‚Äîand Voila!
These influences negatively impact our kids' motivation. To successfully navigate the effects of social media, screen addiction, and passive entertainment,¬†it‚Äôs imperative our children's brains stay fit and they retain the motivation to learn.
That‚Äôs where you come in.
And where the growth mindset shines. It‚Äôs the internal motivation that urges us to learn and become better every day.

What Is Autocratic Leadership? Pros, Cons, and Right Use
 
                                    August

Leadership styles play a pivotal role in shaping a company‚Äôs success and dramatically impact the work culture.
One commonly used style is autocratic leadership, easily recognized by a leader who makes unilateral decisions without seeking input from others. While this approach can be necessary in some situations, in our modern business, the Millennials‚Äîthe largest generation in today's workplace‚Äîare challenging this traditional leadership style. Therefore, it's essential to recognize both its pros and cons and how to apply it sparingly and effectively.

It's been said that relationships are the hardest yoga. I agree that relationships take the same focus, effort, and flexibility. 
In marriage and other romantic relationships, as in yoga, we salute the sun each day, seeking to honor the best in ourselves, our partner, and our lives together. We bend by adapting to life's unexpected curveballs; we twist when we wrestle with conflict; and we stretch by striving to love our partner even when it's not always easy. And when we seek poise between autonomy and intimacy, it can be as challenging as a one-armed side plank.

When I was a young mother, there were many times I felt like I was failing as a parent‚Äîand I even taught parenting classes! It's so easy to get overwhelmed or discouraged as a parent, isn't it? We LOVE our children‚Äîbut let‚Äôs face it: parental burnout is a thing, especially with both parents working.
Parenting demands a lot from us, and we're human. So if you‚Äôve ever wanted the newborn stage to be over or wondered if you‚Äôd survive toddlerhood, or lost your cool with a teenager, you know what I‚Äôm talking about.
Once I learned missing emotional intelligence skills, it was a game-changer for me! [...]

Turn Inward Emotional Turbulence to Inner Peace with These EQ Skills
 
                                    August
                                    07,

For many years, I was consumed by an inward emotional turbulence, continually feeling too emotional and off balance. Eventually, I started getting genuinely curious about why. Turns out that my inability to regulate my emotions was the key culprit. Learning emotional intelligence was a path for me to build skills and create inner peace. By learning basic EQ skills, I could surf and calm the emotional waves, gain self-understanding, replace my brutal inner critic with compassion, and regain my motor of joy. You can, too!
