The Age of Coronavirus combined with working at home and social distancing have caused the demand for our vending machines to skyrocket nationally in some not-so-obvious and lucrative ways:Corporate Vending
On average 20-50% of the staff of large employers across the country are working at the office, the remainder at home. Those employers are suddenly finding their in-office staff no longer has access to convenient food or drink options. This is because most cafeteria and food courts are shut down due to the pandemic or because the food-service operators can’t justify the cost with a fraction of the normal employees working there. Large companies that may have been completely uninterested in vending in the years past are now scrambling for convenient, healthy food options and vendors are getting flooded with calls for vending services.High-Density Residential Vending
Between 50-80% of employees nationwide are working from home in 2022-2023. This means that high-density residential areas like apartments and condos are suddenly lacking in basic access to necessities. We’ve seen a massive increase in purchases for custom “mini-bodega” concept vending machines. Our customers are placing customized machines in and near large multi-family residential complexes with everything from food and drink options to cell phone cables and pain killers.Smart Automated Retail without Employees
Lastly, the pandemic’s lockdown and social distancing requirements exposed the need for agile, inexpensive automated retail. A myriad of industries such as PPE, CBD products, and beauty products have embraced the idea of automated retail through smart custom vending machines.
There are virtually no products that a machine can't be customized to vend, so why not think outside the traditional brick-and-mortar retail store? Call us today to start the process towards building a completely custom automated vending solution for your brand.Shop NowRequest a Free ConsultationWhy Buy A Vending Machine from The Discount Vending Store?
Warranties and Tech SupportAll of our new vending machines come with a one year warranty which covers all parts of the machine.
All of our used, pre-owned or refurbished machines come with a 3 month warranty.
Best of all, when you buy from The Discount Vending Store, we offer a lifetime of technical support on every vending machine we sell. Whether you’ve had your machine for one day or 10 years, we will help you troubleshoot it over the phone, via Skype, Zoom or FaceTime, too. You can get hands-on in-person training in our warehouse in Colorado Springs. We also offer training via Zoom.
We have a large inventory of vending machine parts available.
Vandalism is not covered by our warranty, unfortunately.Inventory TrackingAll of our new machines and most of the refurbished machines have the ability to track the inventory. This is done through robust online tracking software which will track all cash & credit card sales, as well as machine telemetry, connectivity, warnings and alerts, and so much more.Cash / Credit / Mobile PaymentsNo one carries cash these days. All of our machines can take credit cards, mobile payments like Apple Pay and Google Wallet, and even include chip readers for added security.Custom GraphicsWe understand that image is everything and you may want your own branding. Why get a boring black or white machine when you can get the same machine with colorful customized graphics on it which will advertise for you. If you want to wrap the entire machine with custom graphics, we can help with that too for a small additional cost.FinancingWe offer multiple forms of financing to best meet your needs. You can learn more and see if you qualify on our financing page.Satisfaction GuaranteedIf you are not 100% satisfied, you may return your machines within the first 14 days.Shop NowRequest a Free ConsultationWith a background in vending, we understand your need for affordable, reliable, and customizable vending machinesHere’s how we’ve helped a few of our customers just like you solve their problems with our state-of the art new vending machines and quality used vending machines.Discount Vending’s machines are in excellent working condition and a great price.
