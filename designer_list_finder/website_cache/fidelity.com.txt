Small investments could help your money grow

Chart is a hypothetical comparison. Investing involves risk of loss and performance is not guaranteed.








How this chart works

The hypothetical chart above illustrates the potential growth of an investment account assuming a 7% annual nominal investment growth rate vs a .42% National savings account deposit rate as of July 17, 2023* . This chart assumes estimated/average return rates stay constant over the course of the time horizon and that no withdrawals were taken. Taxes, fees, and inflation are not included. Unlike traditional FDIC savings accounts, investments accounts are subject to market risk and do not carry FDIC insurance to protect from loss. Each type of account has its own unique set of potential benefits and limitations that you should consider before deciding what type is right for you.
Interact with the slider to increase or decrease the monthly contribution to discover how the money could grow in an investment account vs an FDIC savings account. The monthly contribution is how much you want to invest every month. In this chart it is set at $250, but you can move the slider from $1 to $1,000 to see how your contributions could grow over time. For example, a $250 monthly contribution in an investment account could grow to $304,993 in 30 years compared to $95,898 in a traditional savings account, using end of month compounding.
This example is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the performance of any security. The assumed rate of return is not guaranteed. Investments that have potential for a 7% rate of return also come with risk of loss. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

Keep in mind that investing involves risk. The value of your investment will fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money.




1. A qualified distribution from a Roth IRA is tax-free and penalty-free. To be considered a qualified distribution, the 5-year aging requirement has to be satisfied and you must be age 59½ or older or meet one of several exemptions (disability, qualified first-time home purchase, or death among them).




2. There is no minimum amount required to open a Fidelity Go account. However, in order for us to invest your money according to the investment strategy you've chosen, your account balance must be at least $10.




3. Zero account minimums and zero account fees apply to retail brokerage accounts only. Expenses charged by investments (e.g., funds, managed accounts, and certain HSAs) and commissions, interest charges, or other expenses for transactions may still apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for further details.
