Steamship is an SDK and hosting platform for AI Agents and Tools.
Follow our Agent Guidebook for a complete tutorial.
Steamship in 30 seconds

Build Agents which run in the cloud.
Use Plugins for common operations like generating text with GPT, converting a CSV to text, or generating an image from text. Steamship manages asynchronicity and retries.
Store data in Files, Blocks, and Tags. This allows you to query or search it later.
Deploy as a Package, creating a scalable API for your front end.
Create as many instances of the Package as you want, each with its own data.

Start from our Multimodal Agent Template
Clone our starter repository:
git clone https://github.com/steamship-core/multimodal-agent-starter
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
 
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
Then run this to use your agent:
ship run local
Now that you've interacted with your new agent, you're ready to start modifying it in src/api.py.
See the Agent Guidebook for details.
