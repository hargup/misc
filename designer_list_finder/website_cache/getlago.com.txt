Donât let your metering and billing system prevent you from improving your pricing and increasing ARR.For Finance teamsClunky data reprocessing, invoicing mistakes, tedious reporting tasks and above all, the anxiety of having missed another detail that had to be addressed manually.The solutionComposable metering and billingUsage monitoringPlug-and-play meteringTired of pre-aggregating and cleaning data, so that it can be used for billing?

Discover our productLoved by engineers around the globeMost engineers donât want to become... billing engineers.Big fan of Lago's work. Payments and billing create huge underrated nightmares for engineers. With their open-source approach, Lago can help solve the long tail of challenges.Lago provides a solid foundation for Billing engineers to build on and customize to their needs. The team is super reactive and experienced in the space too!Joel TaylorSr. Billing Engineer at GithubBilling has millions of edge cases. But itâs also a âtalent nightmareâ. No CTO wants to staff their engineers on billing, and no engineers want to work on this on the long term. I just wish Lago existed five years ago, so that my team could build on top of their API and go back to building our core product asap.Gabriel KleinCTPO at Masteos / ex VP Engineering at QontoI wish Lago existed when we started Algolia.We've revamped our billing stack three times and even went through a failed implementation with Zuora. We totally underestimated the complexity of billing at the time, and our needs were too specific for closed-source vendors.Nicolas DessaigneCo-founder at Algolia / Partner at Y CombinatorDon't spend time, effort and money on things that do not bring business value. Any time I see a company with engineers building something they could buy off the shelf [and the thing they're building is not the product] I know their priorities are whack. [â¦] Just because a tractor is used for farming doesn't mean a farmer should build her own tractor.Read discussion
