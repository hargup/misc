About


I’m currently a software & machine learning engineer at Kensho.
Before joining Kensho, I was a physics graduate student at MIT working with Jeff Gore. 
In my graduate work, I explored how cooperative behaviors in microbes affect the evolution of antibiotic resistance. My work combined an experimental approach together with modeling to study the population dynamics of microbes growing in the presence of antibiotics.  My first project focused on the dynamics between resistant and sensitive bacteria growing in the beta-lactam antibiotic ampicillin. In this project, Sherry Chao and I demonstrated experimentally that it’s possible for antibiotic-resistant bacteria to protect antibiotic-sensitive bacteria against antibiotics, allowing the sensitive bacteria to survive in an environment containing antibiotics (article). In my second project, Arolyn Conwill and I showed that two strains of bacteria can form a mutualism and help each other survive in a multi-drug environment (article). Other publications can be found on my google scholar profile.
During my time as a graduate student, Jonathan Friedman and I released a python package for performing high-throughput data analysis for flow cytometry.
In the far past, I completed my undergraduate in physics at the College of Creative Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. At UCSB, I worked with Professor Paul Hansma on an instrument that diagnose the strength of bone in-vivo (see Active Life Scientific).  
During my free time, I play guitar and drink tea… but mostly I just drink tea.
