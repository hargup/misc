Personal SiteAashay SanghviI'm a Partner at Haystack, a venture capital firm run by a small team. Over the last decade, Haystack has been an early investor in DoorDash, Instacart, Hashicorp, Figma, Applied Intuition, Ironclad, Redpanda, and many other startups. I work across all of our investing activity, and have sourced and supported software businesses in almost every sector including enterprise / IT, AI / ML, financial services, life sciences, industrials, and more. I joined early in my career and feel lucky that I've found something I want to do for a long time. I'm based in San Francisco, CA. Prior to Haystack, I helped start a furniture company and studied economics and history at Harvard.I am a technology optimist and believe that everything big starts small.ââOn the InternetTwitter, Newsletter, LinkedInâContactaashay [at] haystack dot vc
