Not sure what to do with @EveryDollar now.Kannamathr, 08/24/2022Best budgeting app I’ve usedI almost never leave App Store reviews, but this app has literally changed my life. I’ve tried Mint, Clarity, NerdWallet, SoFi Relay, and various other budget tools, and Copilot has been by far the best for me. My finances are in the best place they’ve been in years, because Copilot’s rollover-based budgeting system and its handling of recurring transactions just “click” with the way I think about money. Well worth the subscription!Ryan44044, 07/01/2022Incredibly capableI’ll preface this by saying this is the first app I’ve ever reviewed. Kudos on an amazing job well done. I’ve gone through so many budgeting apps and they all fell short in one way or another. This one does everything I’ve been looking for and more. I will definitely be subscribing once my trial period is up. Thank you!brock1234-234, 03/23/2022Favorite App I Have!!Copilot is literally my favorite financial tool I’ve ever used. I’ve tried different financial & budgeting tools in the past, excel sheets, etc. but all of them have been difficult to stay on top of my finances. This is by far the easiest I’ve used and extremely well organized. Just link your financial accounts, setup your budget and the app pretty much tracks the rest :)Stephen Ellis@snoopehBig fan of @copilotmoneyI’m a spreadsheets guy and my wife totaly isn’t - I wanted to find a UI/UX that she’d be happy with.She loves it.Thanks for the rec @blakeirNauzli Dadkhah@nauzliOoh buddy. Downloaded @copilotmoney last night. Crazy impressed w the intuitive UI, ability to set rules against descriptors & merchant categories, & ability to categorize individual Venmo txns. Converted to paying subscription within the hour.Tome Cvitan@cvitanI have to give a shout out to @copilotmoney for making an absolutely excellent budgeting / money app, with a sustainable monetization strategy that is not about selling my data. (Not affiliated with them, just spent a bit too much time evaluating money apps :)Nate Bosshard@natebosshardNo idea who is behind this app but it instantly went to my homescreen and converted into a paid customer. Best personal financial product I’ve ever used.Giullian93, 01/08/2022Best financial app I have used.Copilot listens to their customers and provides an excellent integration experience. Taking care of my finances is much easier now and I don’t worry about my data being sold since I pay for the app. That security is very important to me. Also, the Venmo integration is just awesome!PokeJD, 03/04/2022Helped bring domestic tranquilityMy wife and I were continually bickering over our budget when we were using other budgeting apps. This one has really helped us both stay on the same page and work together. Quickly and easily syncs and is intuitive to use.KJP0123, 02/13/2022Way better than Mint and worth the costI’ve used Mint for 7 years and I am never going back now. Copilot is so much easier to manage because it’s rule system actually keeps items in the correct category and you don’t have to worry about pending transactions changing because it updates the correct transaction when it changes. Also love that there are no ads and love that it has a super responsive help and feedback request feature which I’ve already used multiple times.Great app!! Totally worth it if you’re switching from Mint. I also have tried every budgeting app out there (Simplify, YNAB, etc) and this blows them all away.Read more tweetsHonest and thoughtful pricingTest drive for freeTake Copilot for a spin before you connect a single account.
