Your dating life, all in one place

              Record all of your dating contacts in one central location. No
              need to rifle through a dozen apps to find a date's phone number
              or other important details.
            

              Create qualified dating opportunities (QDOs). View your historical
              dating stats and future pipeline.
            







Keep track of your contacts

              Sort by the last time you were in touch so you can prioritize by
              recency.
            





Set reminders to follow up

              Perfect if you've got a busy week at work or are traveling but
              don't want to forget for your future bae.
            





View your dating history

              See your past activity with any contact so you can remember the
              important details.
