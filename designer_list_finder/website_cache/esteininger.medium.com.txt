However, implementing machine learning is not a straightforward task and comes with certain pitfalls. We’ll dive into the top five pitfalls that companies might face in ML implementation, along with…Mlops3 min readMlops3 min readJul 18Building a Vector Search Engine Using HNSW and Cosine SimilarityHierarchical Navigable Small World graphs (HNSW) is an algorithm that allows for efficient nearest neighbor search, and the Sentence Transformers library allows for the generation of semantically meaningful sentence embeddings. We will be using the HNSWlib python library for our tutorial, which provides a fast and memory-efficient implementation of HNSW. But first why? …Vector Search3 min readVector Search3 min readJul 14The Growth Stack for Early-Stage StartupsHaving the right tech infrastructure can dramatically expedite the process of early market validation, improving efficiency, productivity, and scalability. This article will delve into the importance of an early company/product growth stack, highlighting the various tools that can bolster a company’s growth trajectory. The Power of the Right Tech Stack Establishing a robust tech stack early on…Startup4 min readStartup4 min readJun 8The Broken Jet Stream Behind NYC’s Smoke InvasionToday, New York City was cloaked in a hazy shroud. The reason? Wildfires raging in Ontario, Canada. Usually, prevailing winds would carry the smoke eastwards over the Atlantic, but this isn’t the case now. The wind is blowing in a different direction, carrying the smoke southwards instead, resulting in the…Climate Change5 min readClimate Change5 min readMay 10MongoDB and Pinecone: Building Real-Time AI ApplicationsI’ve built dozens of applications where Mongo DB was the system of record, and that’s unlikely to change. Old habits die hard after all. However, as AI capabilities and vector search engines become more available, satisfying complicated use cases such as semantic search becomes easier. I’m going to walk you…Mongodbpinecone4 min readMongodbpinecone4 min readMay 3Why Pursuing a BHAG is Worth the StruggleBig Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG) is a term coined by Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in their book “Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies.” A BHAG is a long-term, ambitious goal that can inspire people to work towards a common vision. …Bhag2 min readBhag2 min readApr 13So you want to become a unicornLearn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable. I’ve bet my career on this quote, and it’s more true than ever in the age of A.I. where software is democratized. A prevailing concern is that A.I. will upend the labor market, rendering large…Artificial Intelligence5 min readArtificial Intelligence5 min readMar 22An Open-Source, Personalized Generative Model FrameworkCustom, generative models are the future. Whether you’re crafting video montages and chatbots or producing audio summaries and image montages they all require the same data pipelines. Engineers need to prepare and process the source of truth, then fine-tune and deploy the generative models for their specific use cases.
