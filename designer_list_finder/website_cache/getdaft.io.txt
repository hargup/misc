Use-Cases#


Data Science Experimentation
Daft enables data scientists/engineers to work from their preferred Python notebook environment for interactive experimentation on complex data


Complex Data Warehousing
The Daft Python dataframe efficiently pipelines complex data from raw data lakes to clean, queryable datasets for analysis and reporting.


Machine Learning Training Dataset Curation
Modern Machine Learning is data-driven and relies on clean data. The Daft Python dataframe integrates with dataloading frameworks such as Ray and PyTorch to feed data to distributed model training.


Machine Learning Model Evaluation
Evaluating the performance of machine learning systems is challenging, but Daft Python dataframes make it easy to run models and SQL-style analyses at scale.




Key Features#


Python UDF
Daft supports running User-Defined Functions (UDF) on columns of Python objects - if Python supports it Daft can handle it!


Interactive Computing
Daft embraces Python's dynamic and interactive nature, enabling fast, iterative experimentation on data in your notebook and on your laptop.


Distributed Computing
Daft integrates with frameworks such as Ray to run large petabyte-scale dataframes on a cluster of machines in the cloud.
