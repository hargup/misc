Exploring data in CockroachDB with Python and Pandas







It might start with a database query




Get this dataset. Or read more about database panels.





But some things are easier to do in code




Read more about code panels.





And not always code in the same language




Read more about code panels.





When you're working on a report








Or a long-term data point




Read more about HTTP panels. Or read more about macros.





And if you deploy the DataStation server
Panels become the building blocks of hosted dashboards and recurring exports
Coming soon :)
