Google Earth Map OverlaysHome Sign inGoogle Earth Map OverlaysHere is a Google Earth KML network link that displays a big variety of tile based online maps (road maps, terrain and contour maps, alternative satellite image sets, etc) in the area you are currently viewing.This allows you to use your favourite map in 3D together with other Google Earth layers to plan a trip, perform geospatial analyses, or simply have better map sources where the data provided by Google is not as good:Move mouse over imageCurrently, 51 different map sources are supported. Most of these maps are based on OpenStreetMap, but there also layers for Google Maps, Bing Maps and an extensive list of regional map providers. You can switch between maps by clicking on them in the side bar:Move mouse over imageWhenever you change the view in Google Earth, the image overlays are automatically updated. Zoom levels for map tiles are calculated independently for different regions in the Google Earth screen, based on distance to the virtual camera and on latitude. Consequently, maps are updated very quickly and the number of map tiles loaded per update is more or less constant, even if the view in Google Earth is tilted.Move mouse over imageSome more questions about how it works are covered in the FAQ.DownloadTo get started, simply download the file map-overlays-for-google-earth-combined.kmz (please log in first, see here why)  and open it in Google Earth. It contains all map sources that this application provides (version 10).Alternatively, separate KML network links for groups of maps or even individual map sources can be found here:OpenStreetMapOpenStreetMap MapnikThunderforest OutdoorsThunderforest LandscapeThunderforest TransportMapQuest Open MapnikMapQuest Open AerialOpenStreetMap KomootOpenStreetMap HikebikemapOpenStreetMap Cycle MapOpenStreetMap Public TransportCloudmade The OriginalCloudmade Fine LineCloudmade TouristCloudmade Red AlertCloudmade FreshCloudmade Pale DawnCloudmade Midnight CommanderOpenStreetMap GPS TracesOpenStreetMap Mapnik B&WGoogle MapsGoogle Maps RoadGoogle Maps TerrainGoogle Maps ChinaGoogle Maps KoreaNokia Here MapsNokia Here Maps RoadNokia Here Maps TerrainNokia Here Maps AerialBing MapsBing Maps RoadBing Maps AerialBing Maps HybridBing Maps ChinaEuropean MapsEuropean Maps OpenTopoMapOutdooractive Maps GermanyOutdooractive Maps AustriaOutdooractive Maps South TyrolNorgeskart Maps (Norway) Topo (Land)Norgeskart Maps (Norway) Topo GrayscaleNorgeskart Maps (Norway) Sea (Sjø)Norgeskart Maps (Norway) Base (Enkel)1881.no Maps (Norway) 1881.no Topo1881.no Maps (Norway) 1881.no AerialEuropean Maps 2GIS (Russia)European Maps Freemap Hiking (Slovakia)North American MapsNorth American Maps Caltopo USGS TopoNorth American Maps OSM Terrain USUSGS The National Map Area FillsUSGS The National Map StructuresUSGS The National Map ContoursUSGS The National Map HydrographyWorld MapsWorld Maps Maps-For-Free ReliefWorld Maps Nasa Blue MarbleWorld Maps Mapbox SatelliteFeedbackDo you have comments, bug reports, or suggestions for other map sources?

It's quite tedious to have to download and install every time.  Especially because I like to rearrange the order, and delete overlays I don't like or won't use.Martin Loetzsch (2014-03-13 21:52:18):In the beginning I had separate versioning for map groups and even single map sources. This had two problems: It was quite difficult to get working right and people never came back to this site (which pays the server costs through ads).I could build a more fine-grained update solution, but that would require me to ask for a usage fee, which I guess nobody wants.MartinStan (2014-04-17 10:19:23):Hi Martin,this is really cool!

This is really a great service that I hope gets more publicity as it helps put OSM at the hands of so many people that use GE.Thanks also for your latest addition of three more Thunderforest styles (by Andy Allan). Great additions.Now, two suggestions and a request:* You might want to move the currently named "Cycle Map" layer under Thunderforest in your next version as it's also a "Thunderforest style" (by Andy Allan) and rename it to OpenCycleMap, which Andy uses for it.* It would be great and also inline with the licenses / use permissions of the map styles to include appropriate map (tiles) license information (that would include attribution and note of the license under which the different OSM maps are offered for reuse and distribution).While the relatively new ODbL license of the OSM data allows nowadays to publish maps created with OSM data under traditional restrictive licenses I think that all of the maps you have included here are licensed under a permissive license or at least there's some sort of fair use clause for their use that allow using these. But the license and the attribution should be included in the layers and visible (clearly enough).You already have very good attribution on the pages of the individual map styles and the grouping of the layers in the layer pack indicate attribution (including the use of the logos). But I think the license would be an appropriate addition and would be good to follow the styles consistently.From the top of my mind I think that there would be three good places for the attribution/license info: i) these web pages (as you already have for attribution), ii) the Properties > Description box for each of the map layer (that currently have the URL to the info page of the given layer) and finally it would also be great and appropriate -- and I think many would argue that also required -- to include the info in the map browsing window. E.g. OpenLayers plugin for QGIS does this nowadays automatically albeit the info is not perfect for all available layers. But the MapQuest OSM style is a prime example of attribution and license statement done right. (Lower right corner gets a text of "Data, imagery and map information provided by [MapQuest], [OpenStreetMap], and contributors, [CC-BY-SA]" where [] brackets indicate corresponding hyperlinks).I would be happy to help you figure out an appropriate placing of the license and attribution if you want/need help.Lastly,* It would be great to see the Humanitarian map style added to your layers. The style was developed originally as part of one Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team mapping project to function as a general map style with a twist/focus for the needs of humanitarian and international development work. But it's really a general style well suited for many needs. The style is available at https://github.com/hotosm/H... , the tiles are globally created and available via the French OSM community's server http://layers.openstreetmap... and they are also available among others at osm.org . If you have any questions regarding this don't hesitate to contact me or yohanboniface (the main developer and maintainer of the style).Again, BIG thanks for this wonderful set of map layers! Look forward to inclusion of more good layers and the tweaking of the attributions/license notes.Martin Loetzsch (2015-03-17 20:38:13):Hi Jaakko,thanks for your comments, I'll consider them all. You are right, I will have to do something about licence information.Greetings, MartinHunar Saleem (2015-04-13 06:17:19):What about yahoo maps? is there any overlays for yahoo satellite maps?Martin Loetzsch (2015-04-13 21:07:54):Yahoo unfortunately blocks requests from the Google Earth client, so it is not possible.Opt Pob (2015-07-15 22:08:18):Hi Martin, I suggest to add Sardinia Aerial Maps from here: http://www.sardegnageoporta...There are 7 layers but the most important are 4: Ortofoto 1954, Ortofoto 1968, Ortofoto 1977 and Ortofoto 2000.Tiles source:1954) http://webgis.regione.sarde...

The public land ownership data in all of the layers, at least in California, is rather inaccurate. Your users might be interested in this higher quality data set for California:The California Protected Areas Database (CPAD) 2015b is a GIS inventory of all protected park and open space lands in California (https://gis.cnra.ca.gov/arc.... The database contains lands held in fee ownership by public agencies and non-profits - it does not contain data on private conservation and other similar public agency easements. CPAD is more completely described in the CPAD Manual (http://www.calands.org/uplo... Manual_2015b.pdf ). The lands in the database range from huge national forests to very small urban parks. Federal,state, county, city, special district and non-governmental agency holdings are included and have been mapped at high levels of accuracy.They have Google Earth .kmz versions as well as legends (which can be added by editing Properties in Google Earth and adding the Legend link).

We constantly recommend your product and have for years but we have had complaints about some of your slightly deceptive download buttons.  I know you have to support the site but Google is not in favor of this practice.  I also just noticed that your comments section is supported by Disqus.  Disqus is a slightly obnoxious tracking company that I normally wouldn't use for comments but I'm making an exception because of the quality of your product.  I'd appreciate it if you considered a more straightforward business model.Martin Loetzsch (2016-09-22 22:36:56):Hi Clifford,this whole things started with me wanting to have map overlays in Google Earth for myself. I enjoy cycle touring and hiking and having these maps alongside with 3D terrain, Panoramio images and other placemarks makes planning a trip a great fun for me.Once I built the software, I thought I might as well share it because I knew it might be a thing that other like-minded people would appreciate. About the business model: Running this thing costs some money (not much), which is easily covered by the Adsense revenue (about 200 Euro / month, also not much). I'm a full-time employed software engineer (https://www.linkedin.com/in... ) with two kids, and I absolutely have no time or ambition to implement other revenue streams such as donations or subscriptions.So ads are going to stay on this site. I unfortunately don't have any influence on what ads are served by Google and (living in Germany) I have never seen "download buttons". But I'll address this by marking banners more clearly with some text around it such as "Message from our sponsors".About Disqus: I have absolutely no time to implement my own comment system and to deal with comment spam and security. Disqus does a great job for me in terms of not having to bother about spam. If you can suggest another worry-free hosted comment system, I'd be happy to switch.I hope you are nevertheless able to enjoy these overlays as much as I do,MartinAly (2017-02-01 10:46:42):Many maps are outdated wirth broken linksCan you update the URI to have them working again ?Martin Loetzsch (2017-02-01 11:46:54):I plan to take some time for this during the second week of March.Paolo Z (2017-03-21 17:23:14):Hi Martin, thank you for your great job!Have you seen the watermark "API Key Required" in the Cycle map layer?lpto (2017-03-31 09:02:39):Here seems to be broken...
