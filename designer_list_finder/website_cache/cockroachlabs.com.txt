Scale fast.


Survive disaster.


Thrive everywhere.











True elastic scale
CockroachDB makes scale so simple, you don't have to think about it. It automatically distributes data and workload demand. Break free from manual sharding and complex workarounds.

                    











Indestructible data
Downtime isn’t an option, and data loss destroys companies. CockroachDB is architected to handle unpredictability and survive machine, datacenter, and region failures.











Local and global data
CockroachDB lets you scale across multiple regions and tie data to a location to ensure peak performance for local and global deployments. Row-level controls also help safeguard your business against ever-changing data privacy laws.
