HorseThe Browser for ResearchGet a Horsejapanese teasGoogle SearchSenchaWikipediaHōjichaWikipediaGenmaichaWikipediaMatchaWikipediaGreen TeaWikipediaNew Ways to Enjoy Green TeaKonMariAh, gather close, esteemed peers, and let us ponder a curious vision of the future. As I delicately cradle this teacup, swirling its aromatic contents, I've been privy to whispers of a forthcoming age where our voracious appetite for knowledge might lead to a peculiar kind of chaos. You see, the grandeur of future generations may extend their telegraphic capabilities so much that they can peruse not one, not two, but multitudes of documents at once – all through the marvels of electric ingenuity!Imagine, if you will, a great, sprawling desk upon which sit myriad documents received via telegraph. One might open a scroll about the latest fashions in Paris, only to be distracted by another on the intricacies of steam engine modifications. But alas! The sheer volume of scrolls overwhelms the desk, with some almost teetering over the edge, lost to oblivion. Such might be the fate of those who attempt to embrace all the knowledge at once, lost amidst a sea of parchment.Yet fear not, for amidst these tidings, I've also caught wind of an invention - a 'Stable Keeper', if you will. This Keeper promises to tend to all our scrolls diligently, ensuring none are misplaced or forgotten. A guardian for the overwhelmed mind, as one tries to navigate the grand telegraphic library of the future.Of course, we must remember our place in this vast timeline. Today, we marvel at locomotives and the phonograph, finding joy in the simpler pleasures. The perils of too many telegraphic documents seem almost fantastical, a challenge for future ladies and gentlemen to decipher.Nonetheless, as I finish my tea and reflect on these musings, it brings forth a gentle reminder. Whether it's the telegrams of today or the overflowing scrolls of tomorrow, balance, dear friends, is the key to savoring life's vast repository of wonders. Let us hope our descendants heed this wisdom. Cheers!Overwhelmed by Tabs all day?Find yourself Googling for the same pages?

browser.horse

传统的浏览器多页签都是平级的，很容易在打开多个页签之后搞不清关系迷失其中。这款浏览器每点击一个链接都会打开页签，而且多页签呈多层级方式在侧边栏显示，便于用户以主题的方式归纳浏览过的网页。付费每年 99 美元订阅或 299 美元买断 https://t.co/DcLBjWHcAD3:14 PM - Jun 16, 2023Marvin Vogt@SRv6d@PascalPixel Although it was a bit of a learning curve initially, I’m really enjoying horse so far, it’s very calming once you get the hang of it.1:25 PM - Jun 3, 2023Pippi Haruka@goooonzaHorse(ホース)を使い始めました🐴タブ開きっぱなしかつ、階層構造で保たれてとても使いやすい。さっき開いたタブを見失わない😭👏

Many browsers present themselves as the saviour from tab hell, but they end up forcing users to adopt new habits and expend a lot of mental energy to make it work.

But its wide-ranging benefits make Horse the perfect tool for everyone. Rather than focusing on the little window that shows the web, Horse embraces a deeper understanding of genuine user interaction, including the web itself in its design.
