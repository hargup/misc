Synthesizing visual worlds





I'm an AI researcher at UC Berkeley, where I work on generative models. My work includes diffusion models, text-to-3D with NeRFs, and scalable ML systems.
    Previously, I was at Google Brain, NVIDIA Research, Uber ATG, and Facebook AI. I graduated from MIT with an S.B. in Computer Science and was a director of the nonprofit Machine Intelligence Community. At MIT, I did research at CSAIL and the Media Lab. My research is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
