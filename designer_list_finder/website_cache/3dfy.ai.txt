3DFY Prompt

















Everything 3D, Now.


3·d·fy /'θri:di:faɪ, three-dee-feye/ verb: AI-powered 3D model generation at scale -3·d·fied_adj. -3·d·fier_n.























NEW!3DFY Prompt – from text to 3D model in an instant


3DFY.ai uses generative artificial intelligence to create high quality 3D models from text (just describe what you want) and allow you to express yourself – in 3D.

Launch 3DFY Prompt










3DFY.ai democratizes the creation of 3D content


Until now, the growing demand for 3D content has been confined by the limitations of legacy solutions: Photogrammetry, 3D scanning, and manual creation.They're expensive, time-consuming, and non-scalable.


3DFY.ai is built to meet the demand requirements of the future.








Growing demand for 3D content is not being met by current methods


Until now, the growing demand for 3D content has been restricted by the limitations of legacy solutions: photogrammetry, 3D scanning, and manual creation. They're expensive, time-consuming, and non scalable.


3DFY.ai enables 3D content creation for everyone








Designed to create high-quality 3D assets at scale


3DFY.ai’s proprietary, AI-powered, 3D generation pipeline was designed according to two main principles: First, as we do not compromise on 3D asset quality﻿, our entire tech stack is designed to produce 3D models adhering to high quality standards, similar to what a modeler would produce. Furthermore, as we know scale matters, we built our technology with automation at its core, so human labor is eliminated, unlocking limitless 3D asset creations.


Our solutions cater both for individual self-expression or business use cases where mass generation of 3D models is required, such as generating large 3D datasets of digital items according to your specifications, or creating 3D virtual objects according to textual prompts. All items are generated in an automated manner without compromising quality.








Assembled to scale 3D generation


3DFY.ai’s proprietary, AI powered, 3D generation pipeline was designed according to two main principles: First, as we do not compromise on 3D asset quality, our entire tech stack is designed to produce 3D models adhering to modern quality standards, similar to what a modeler would produce. Furthermore, as we know scale matters, we built our technology with automation at its core, so human labor is eliminated, unlocking limitless 3D asset creations.


Our solutions cater for both individual self-expression and business use cases which require mass generation of 3D models, such as generating large tailored 3D datasets of digital items, or creating 3D virtual objects according to textual prompts. All items are high quality, and generated automatically.
