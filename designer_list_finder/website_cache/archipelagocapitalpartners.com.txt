Investing in People.We invest our private capital in Search Funds to help talented entrepreneurs become successful CEOs.
































Â 

Search.The decision to acquire a business is both an exciting and a daunting undertaking. Through research and experience we have created a framework to successfully guide Searchers through this process. We have backed over 75 Search Funds and studied what works and what does not. We are passionate about sharing this knowledge with our Searchers.Acquire.Finding the right business to buy is only half of the battle. Coming to terms during the acquisition phase presents a host of challenges and considerations. Surprisingly, the highest bidder does not always win. We work with our Searchers to identify the valuable intangibles they bring to the table, the best way to build rapport with the seller, how to craft a compelling offer and how to close the deal.Grow.As attractive as a company may be pre-acquisition, it takes time to grow a lasting and successful business. Investing our private capital allows us to take a patient approach. In turn, our CEOs have the space to confidently grow into prominent leaders and build powerful organizations.
