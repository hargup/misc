MEET THE FOUNDER
Hi, I’m Ali Abdaal 👋
I started my YouTube channel in 2017 when I was still in medical school. Back then YouTube was just a passion project while I was training to become a doctor.
But my channel kept growing and with that, I kept investing more time into making YouTube videos. In 2020 I passed 1 million subscribers and soon after I launched The Part-Time YouTuber Academy. The site that you’re currently on.
Fast forward to today.

I've been able to quit my job and go full-time on being an entrepreneur, writer and YouTuber.
My YouTube channel has more than 4,500,000 subscribers and brings $4,000,000+ in revenue each year 🤯 
Over 370,000 people read my weekly email newsletter
My team and I have created bulletproof programs on starting a life-changing YouTube channel to give you the best shot at growing on YouTube.

I've documented literally everything I've ever learned about growing on YouTube in this Academy.
And if you fancy learning from me to shortcut your own learning curve, you're in the right place 😉 Scroll down to check out the different programmes within the Academy.
