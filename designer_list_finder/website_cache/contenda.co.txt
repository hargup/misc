			Case Study
		








10x more engagement...
				Redpoint found a LinkedIn post formula that really worked for
				them. They were getting 10x engagement compared to previous
				posts.
			
				But the problem was, their previous format only took 10 minutes
				to produce, but this new format took someone a whole hour to
				write.
			...with 10x speed
				With Contenda, they were able to draft those posts in just 5
				minutes. Drive more engagement while doing less.
