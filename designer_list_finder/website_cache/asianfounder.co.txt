The curation is great. The quality of the people, in terms of their ambitions, integrity, and values are so aligned with what I'm looking for in a friendship. There are people who are not only very driven, but genuine people who I can hang out with on a personal level. In terms of the quality of the events themselves, I think the creativity, amount of planning, and attention to detail have been some of the best I've attended New York.""I can honestly say that I've made some of the best friends that I've had in New York through Asian Founders Club.

These people are incredibly authentic and super impressive at a very young age. They're the kinds of people that I wanted to surround myself, but wasnât able to find until I started going to AFC events. The organizers do a really good job curating the people, and not just in meeting them, but in really getting to know them.Iâm not a big networking person. There's a lot of tech events where itâs hard to meet anyone interesting because thereâs so many people, or it feels transactional because itâs a networking event.What I value is getting to know somebody on a much deeper level, especially somebody who truly understand the same struggles. I feel like AFC fills that gap. No other community has been able to hit that for me.""The people that I've met through Asian Founders Club, I continue to keep in touch with them even six months later.

Everyone is on their own grind. New York City moves so fast, it can be really lonely.But the crowd AFCÂ brought together, everyone was genuinely so nice; I've never felt uncomfortable or scared at any of these events. Iâve met some pretty incredible people who Iâm still good friends with to this day, so Iâm very grateful for the events AFC has held.""Normally, I dread going to one-off networking events or founder dinners because most of the time, you don't actually meet people you truly connect and form a deeper relationship with.

Through that experience, we discovered the value of community for those forging their own paths. When youâre young, starting something can be lonely, unstable, and difficult to truly empathize with.Being in NYC, we wanted to create an intimate space for Asian Gen Z founders and creators to feel seen and supported by other people who understand.JOINÂ NOW
