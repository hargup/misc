I am not there, Not in that hollow place, Not anymore,  And I never will be again;   I leave you my ghost...   As the silvered mist hangs, Like cobwebs, Tangled through the greying moss...   There's something sinister  Within your heavy, wicked gaze, Something that hungers To shred my tender flesh;   Knowing I've escaped...   A simple breath Behind my heart- I can feel it, In every sense; Nothing will ever  Slake my endless thirst...   I never knew The way the mountains sing When it rains, How flowers freckle the forest, Or how to truly dream...   Never understood... Until now.KalineReine1227Landscape 1VicEberly2480sweet liesveroklotz31156Tales of foamphotosens72114Asuna Yuuki Cosplay Bleedingg1179Battle For The MirrorChaosFissure11208[OC] - Mirackiel, Lord of the Angels Majin746143CommissionMisterTrixter7285Explore TopicsExplore moreAI ArtDigital ArtFan ArtPhotographyFantasyAnime and MangaResourcesExplore Team JournalsView AllSupport by team, journalSupportApr 21, 2022Check out the links below to get help from the DeviantArt Team or request new features!

But alas, it was not to be, The same old patterns persisted, The same old ideas recycled, The same old concepts, exhausted. I had hoped for something new, Something that would challenge me, Something that would make me think. But instead, I got the same old thing. The same old recycled moonshine.  It was like a slap in the face. It was like a reminder that the world had not changed at all. I was disappointed, But not surprised. After all, art is a reflection of the times, And the times were still the same. We were still human, With the same fears and desires, The same hopes and dreams. So it was no wonder that art was still the same, Just a different coat of paint on the same old canvas. But perhaps one day, When the world has truly changed, We will create art that is truly new, Art that reflects the future, Not the past. Until then, We will have to make do with what weUnearthlyDemagogueAI3538NextDeviantArt - HomepageDeviantArt FacebookDeviantArt InstagramDeviantArt TwitterAboutContactCore MembershipDeviantArt ProtectDevelopersAdvertiseTerms of ServiceEtiquetteCareersPrivacy PolicyCopyright PolicyHelp and FAQWatch the official DA Team profile for news, product releases, and devious activities:Watch TeamÂ©2023 DeviantArtAll rights reservedJoin the world's largest art community and get personalized art recommendations.Log InJoinorContinue with Google
