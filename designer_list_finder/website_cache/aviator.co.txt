The Tari repo now moves fast, with multiple PRs per day that are often updated. Aviator's MergeQueue is the exact solution we needed, taking strain off of developers, reviewers, and maintainers. MergeQueue makes managing a constant stream of PRs as easy as "Hello World".Niall PatersonDirector of Engineering, Butternut BoxAviator has massively relieved developer frustration in terms of having to constantly monitor PRs. It has given our team the confidence to "set and forget" many previously manual workflows - fantastic!Chintan ParikhHead of Compliance Engineering, SecureframeAviator has saved our team a lot of headache associated with merge processes. I no longer have to worry about insidious semantic conflicts that break our builds and drive development to a halt. Managing our main branch has become frustration free - our builds are always deploy-ready.Brett ComnesSoftware Engineer, SocketAddressing flaky tests with Aviator has saved me hours a week, and in some cases saved me the entire week.Daniel PadiernosSenior Software Engineer, Health CatalystNo more merge request anxiety - it set me free!Enzo BiancatoCTO, TestRigorAviator saved us countless hours of engineering time. Now our engineers no longer need to constantly attend to their PRs because rebases are happening automatically.Robert-Jan HuijsmanFounding Engineer, Reboot.devWe wanted strong guarantees in our developer workflow: every PR must pass human review and automated tests, and those tests must run with the branch completely up to date with the latest main. Aviator made it feasible to have higher standards for our CI while making the development process easier.Let us show you how it worksGet started for freeNot sure if Aviator is right for you?
