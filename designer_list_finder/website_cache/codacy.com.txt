LOVE CODE & what it can do for our CUSTOMERS 
















41% increase incode coverage


                               "When we started measuring things, on average, we were at 23% coverage of the 25-30 applications that were covered. Since then, that has grown; we now have 80 applications with test coverage, and the average test coverage has gone up to 64%"
                            
Tobias SjöstenHead of Software Engineering









60% decrease intech support time


                                "A lot of our YouTube publishing pipeline is now covered through this. (...) it hit 70% code coverage across those pieces, and we've reduced our tech support time by about 60%"

ISO 27001compliance made easy


                                "This certification tells our clients we are compliant with good security practices and that they are audited yearly (...) By using the [Codacy] tool we can fulfill that requirement and prove to the auditor, and it's a big help for our developers."

                                Head of Infrastructure and Security
                            











lot of visibility  into the quality


                                "We tried Codacy for about a month. And we liked it immediately because it was a lot easier to set up. It gave us a lot of visibility into the quality of the code and all the tools it had for code linting and static analysis. (…) We knew that it [Codacy] was a keeper."

Codacy helps us with  the code analysis


                         "Putting Bandit in the local machine is good, but we need something that’s on the server so that when they do the review, code quality is automatically checked. So Codacy helps us with the static code analysis of the review."
