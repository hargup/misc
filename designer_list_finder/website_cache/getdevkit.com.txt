                    and are almost always riddled with ads. You can't know for
                    sure if they are leaking your sensitive data or not. We make
                    money purely through carefully designed ads and
                    subscriptions. So, our business model allows to keep the
                    best interests of our users in mind.Also, we are fanatical about developer experience and we are committed to building the most intutive tools for each common usecase.How is this different from what DevUtils?DevUtils is a macOS-only app. We believe a lot more
    developers will be able to make use of the common utilities
    if they were free and could be accessed on a browser in a
    matter of seconds. Also, our design and variety of tools are
    quite different from it.How is this different from what CyberChef?We feel CyberChef is not very friendly to use. The recipe
    model is not very intuitive at least to new users. Crafting
    a separate tool for each common usecase seems like a better
    approach.DevKitThe Essential Developer ToolkitProductTeamOpportunitiesCommunityCompanyTwitterGitHubInstagramLegalTermsPrivacyRefundCopyright Â© 2022 - 2023 DevKit. All rights reserved.
