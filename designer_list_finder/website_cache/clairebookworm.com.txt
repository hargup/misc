Claire WangHomeProjectsResumeWritingScrapbookClaire Wang.Hey! I'm Claire; thanks for stopping by! I'm fascinated about neuroscience and computer science and have done some budding research in these fields as well as various related ventures and social projects. If you ever see me, I'll probably either be talking about Hack Club, expressing my ever-lasting love for Imagine Dragons & my Spotify playlists, ranting about books, or making an absolute banger of a pun. I truly believe in the art of making for the betterment of the world while having fun doing so.
