We’re not coders. Our customers aren’t coders. Although many (EMS platforms we evaluated) did a lot of different things well, only Bizzabo did almost all of them.Dominick FitzgeraldDirector, Virtual & HybridVidionixWe partnered with Bizzabo because we knew the in-person experience needed to be damn-near flawless — and that’s exactly what we got.Emily WolfeSenior Manager, Events & ExperiencesRiskalyze

The proof is in the performanceThe proof is in the performanceHow Agora used Bizzabo to deliver an epic hybrid user conferenceWhen we saw Bizzabo had strong capabilities for both in-person and virtual audiences, it was a major factor in our decision. We tried a few different companies that were a bit smaller, and they didn’t perform as well.
