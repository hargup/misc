We've also looked at their scorecarding functionality for the same purpose. We share snippets across the various teams. Send snippets to marketing when discussing competitors, send them to product when feedback or enhancements pop up, send them over to engineering when product issues arise. Super helpful sharing the voice of the prospect/customer across the company.Read full reviewAshley W, Associate Training Manager“Very Helpful Platform - Would Recommend”The insights we get from Chorus, such as average talk time, average filler words, and their actionable tagging features, make training and enablement a breeze. On the admin end, it's easy to add teams in a hierarchical order and create specific permissions based on what the team needs to see. The salespeople have implemented the platform easily since Chorus automatically connects to Zoom and it truly only provided positive benefits to them. Lastly, I love that Chorus feels like a partner to our organization. We work with our rep regularly, which of course is helpful, but as a new member of my team I was able to speak with her about best practices and get comfortable enough to hold my own training on the platform within the first 3 months of using it.Read full reviewLaura O, Account Executive“Chorus by ZoomInfo is my #1 Asset”I joined my company a few months back, and as I've been onboarding, the tool that has helped me grow the most, without a doubt, is Chorus by ZoomInfo. Being able to not only listen to other team members' calls to learn from them but to listen to my own calls has been an integral part of my learning and ramp process. I prepare for every single one of my calls by listening to other people's similar calls. I also utilize listening to my own calls as a part of my sales motion. It helps me be completely present during calls that I don't have to take notes. I can ask better questions and be fully present. I also have a tool to look back and see how I'm growing and what areas I need to work on. 10/10 would recommend Chorus by ZoomInfo to anyone in sales.Read full reviewReady to own your market?
