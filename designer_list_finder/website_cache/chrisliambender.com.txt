        How can programmable money align market systems with human values?
      

        Currently, I'm building a new crypto exchange based on strong
        zero-knowledge cryptography:
        Renegade.

        Previously, I shipped a port of Tornado Cash to Solana,
        the first zero-knowledge application on the Solana network:
        Otter Cash.
      

        Before that, I tried to align incentives in politics by making markets on city equity:
        CityStocks.
      

        I studied pure math and computer science at Berkeley. I was involved with
        Machine Learning at Berkeley,
        Accel Scholars,
        and
        Berkeley AI Research.
        I've previously worked at 
        Nuro
        and Tesla Autopilot.
