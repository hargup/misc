Trusted & Backed By Our Users01Â· DeployServerless GPU Model DeploymentDeploy all major MLÂ frameworks such as Pytorch, Onnx or models from HuggingFace etc with 1 line of code. Don't have your own models? Deploy our prebuilt models that have been optimised to run with sub-second latency.One Click Deploymentsnavigate_nextDeploy models from our optimised library such as Flan-T5, Stable Diffusion with one clickSupport all major frameworksnavigate_nextWe support custom model deployments of all major frameworks such as Pytorch, Tensorflow, XGBoost etcEnsemble Modelsnavigate_nextChain together LLM's and custom models to create unique functionality - all in one line





Pre/Post processing functionsAdd logic before and after models in order to get it into the right format.Automatic VersioningEvery time you deploy a model, we version it so you can rollback with the click of a button.Cold starts < 1sWe have put a lot of work into our architecture that cold starts even for LLMs like Flan-T5 and GPT Neox are < 1 second.Powerful serverless GPU'sWe run a combination of Nvidia T4's, A10's and A100's and only charge you for your inference time.02Â· TrainingEffortless fine-tuning BetaFine-tune smaller models on particular tasks in order to decrease costs and latency while increasing performance. It takes just a few lines of code and don't worry about infrastructure, we got it.GPT- NEOnavigate_nextEleutherAI' open-source models - a great alternative to GPT3Stable Diffusionnavigate_nextStability AI latent text-to-image model capable of generating imagesLLaManavigate_nextLarge language model from Meta AI with 7B to 65B parameters1from cerebrium import trainer23hyperparameters = {4"num_train_epochs": 30,5"num_warmup_steps": 100,6"batch_size": 15,7"weight_decay": 0.018}910run_id = trainer("gpt-neox-20b", "train_dataset.jsonl",11hyperparameters)1213Training job started!
