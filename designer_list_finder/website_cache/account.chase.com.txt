                            help you get started, open additional accounts, and move funds
                            over to Chase.
Same page link returns to footnote reference 1 There is no Chase fee at non-Chase ATMs. Chase will refund ATM fees charged by
                            the ATM owner/network. This benefit will begin the next business day after opening
                            the account. Some ATM owners/networks do not identify these fees in the
                            information they send to us and, as a result, we may not automatically refund the
                            fee. If for any reason the refund is not processed, please contact us. There is no
                            Foreign Exchange Rate Adjustment Fee when conducting transactions in a foreign
                            currency. If you choose to convert an international transaction to U.S. dollars at
                            either an ATM or on a purchase, foreign currency commissions and fees included in
                            the exchange rate charged by third parties are excluded from Chase
                            reimbursements. The "No Chase Fee" benefit applies based on your account having this benefit when the debit card or ATM transaction is posted on the account.
 Same page link returns to footnote reference 2 
						   For wire transfers, the "No Chase Fee" benefit applies to the Wire Transfer Fees section listed on the Fee Schedule of the Additional Banking Services and Fees, which can be found at chase.com/disclosures, and does not apply to the spread we include in the foreign currency exchange rate. Financial institutions may deduct processing fees and/or charges from the amount of the incoming or outgoing wire transfers, including on returned wire transfers.

Same page link returns to footnote reference 3Enrollment in Zelle® with a U.S. checking or savings account is required to use the service. Chase customers must use an eligible Chase consumer or business checking account, which may have its own account fees. Consult your account agreement. To send money to or receive money from a small business, both parties must be enrolled with Zelle® directly through their financial institution's online or mobile app experience. Funds are typically made available in minutes when the recipient's email address or U.S. mobile number is already enrolled with Zelle® (go to enroll.zellepay.com to view participating banks).

Only send money to people and businesses you trust.

Same page link returns to footnote reference 5We will decline or return transactions when you do not have enough money in your account to cover the charge. However, you could still end up with a
				negative balance if, for example, a transaction is approved for one amount, but then the actual charge is more than what you have in your account (like
				when you add a tip at a restaurant after the transaction for the meal was already approved). Even if you have a negative balance, we will not charge you an overdraft fee.
Same page link returns to footnote reference 6For Chase Secure CheckingSM only: Early direct deposit is a service that comes with your Chase Secure Checking account in which we credit your eligible direct deposit transaction up to two business days early.

This means when these transactions are credited could vary and you may not receive your funds early. Eligible transactions are certain ACH credit transactions such as payroll, government benefits or similar transactions.

Any existing funds or new deposit and/or investments funds (including funds used for down payment) that exit your accounts prior to closing will be deducted from your eligible transfer amount (you will not be penalized for changes in market value).

Account Eligibility: Qualifying personal banking and/or investment balances will be used in determining the appropriate mortgage rate discount.
