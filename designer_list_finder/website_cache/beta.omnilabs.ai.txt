Forget searching everywhere for information.









Your traditional workflow involves jumping between tabs, browsing through Notion docs, or leaving your workspace to find relevant files or information—only to get distracted and waste hours on another rabbit hole.
The Omni extension proactively surfaces exactly what you need, when you need it. All you have to do is type or select text in your browser. Omni instantly retrieves the most relevant lines from all your documents, books, favorite websites, Zoom transcriptions, Notion docs, and more—displaying them directly inside your work environment, in real-time. No new tabs, no distractions.



















I.









Compound your team's knowledge.




                          Pull insights from your team's work, instantly. Your teammates' knowledge instantly becomes your knowledge. Omni resurfaces relevant content from meeting transcriptions, user feedback, design documents, and every other kind of important communication at work.

II.









Write 10x faster.




                          Let Omni's AI write high-converting copy for you, at the click of a button. Omni can generate unlimited content - blogs, product descriptions, podcasts, ads, social media posts, and more. 
                          Improve the quality of your critical thinking by generating well-argued contradictions or creative ideas based on any statement. You can even create your own prompts and templates to customize Omni's AI generation to your needs.

III.









Never redo existing work again.



US employees spend almost 6 hours a week doing duplicate work. When you or your teammates are repeating work that has been done before, Omni proactively shows you past work that you should be building on. You and your team will never waste time reinventing the wheel again.

IV.









Towards omniscient research.



See your idea across the entire research literature. Source your citations and conduct literature reviews in seconds instead of hours. Discover where your idea is discussed in your own writing, in research papers, or in the books of others.
