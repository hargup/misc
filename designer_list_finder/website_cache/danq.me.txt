Dan Q







		I'm Dan Q. I've spent the last 25+ years writing things on the Internet.
	

		I work at Automattic and volunteer with Three Rings.
		I live with my partner, her husband, and our two
		children. When I'm not at my desk, I can often be found doing GNSS
		sports, cycling, or travelling.
	

		I believe in open source, an open Web, and open minds. Open relationships are cool, too.

		RSS Zero isn't the path to RSS Joy
		

		Thereâs nothing special about reaching Inbox Zero in your feed reader. Itâs not noble nor enlightened to get to the bottom of your âunreadâ list. Your ð feed ð reader ð is ð not ð

		Found GC2HDCZ Tom Burts Cache 4
		

		Found while walking into High Wycombe to work after dropping my canine caching-companion (pictured) off at the nearby veterinary hospital for an operation. Didnât need her help with
		this easy find, luckily! Shame about all the fly tipping littering this otherwise pleasant path. Greetings from Oxfordshire!Ã Read more â

		Found GC54E29 WAG 16 - Elvendon Valley
		

		The poor little geopupâs only got tiny legs, and the 8km weâve walked so-far has got her pretty tired-out, so thisâll be the last cache of the series before we go and find ourselves
		some lunch and go home. Itâs been a very enjoyable series so far, and I fully intend to return to complete [â¦] Read more â

		Found GC54E1W WAG 15 - Action!
		

		Sometimes the geo-sense âjust worksâ. This was one of those moments. I was approaching the area and checking the distance. Then I walked straight to a likely location. Then I picked
		up the cache. Done and done. Read more â

		Found GC72TZ5 WAG 14 - Wander through Wroxhills
		

		Turning South and crossing our own path, the sun came out at last and we were bathed in glorious warm light. Between that, and the familiarity of the trail we passed, the geopup and
		I completely forgot for a moment that we were out to look for this next cache and overshot it: we had [â¦] Read more â

		Found GC54DR7 WAG 9 - Sausages & Bacon!
		

		Worra lorra porkers! The geopup is a huge fan of sausages but I donât think she understood that the cornucopia she was looking at across the field was the same thing, just a few
		years off being ripe. Great cache container too. TFTC, and letâs chuck an FP in because this series as a whole [â¦] Read more â

		Found GC54DTF WAG 10 - Track-able
		

		The geopup and I tried a couple of likely hiding places before we found this one. A nice-sized container and well-suited to its hiding place, here, TFTC! Read more â

		Couldn't find OK00F7 Pig City Vista
		

		Came by this location while doing the nearby WAG series. Was delighted to see that an OpenCache was on the route too so the geopup and I dedicated the time to a decent search. We
		think we found what was once the hiding place, but the cache itself was sadly nowhere to be seen. Read more â

		Couldn't find GC54DW0 WAG 11 - Panorama
		

		Between nearby GC7QC7R, which acts as a spur to this series, and OK00F7, which sits on (and predates) this series, I was feeling confident of a find hereâ¦ but after an extended
		search the geopup and I had to admit defeat. To be honest, she was willing to give up and press on immediately, having [â¦] Read more â

		Found GC7QC7R Lothal
		

		As a quick diversion from the nearby WAG series, the geopup and I meandered out this way to find this cache. Once I was in the vicinity of the cache something stood out to me as
		unusual, so we went to pick it upâ¦ it turned out to be a chunk of wraught iron, but [â¦] Read more â
