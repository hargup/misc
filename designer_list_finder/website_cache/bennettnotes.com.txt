üëãüèæ Hi, I'm Dave Bennett!

I love learning and 
building








At age 7, I wanted to become a railroad conductor.
Then at age 12, I was obsessed with human cloning and thought I should
become a scientist. At age 14, I got my first video camera and found a new
love for acting. After spending a few summers taking acting classes and
auditioning for independent films, I decided I liked it more behind the camera.


I later became obsessed with this new mobile operating system called
Android and started a YouTube channel about it. It was initially called
Opensourcegangster.
In high school, I produced a
couple of
short films with my friends, and also began experimenting with coding.


In college, I majored in computer science but also participated in
broadcast media on the side. Post college, I currently work as a
software engineer in the cloud infrastructure space.


I love trying all types of things


I have made some
Android applications for fun, and I love to build and tinker with embedded devices.
I also got into politics a bit, serving as the Judge
of Elections in my precinct. And I like to play ultimate frisbee on the side.


I used to be one of those people who had a well detailed five year
plan. Now, I find that to be a fruitless task and waste of energy.
We don‚Äôt know where life will take us. I might be a software
engineer now, but in five years I could decide to take on an
entirely different path and become a comedian or professional bird
watcher. For myself, the only thing that matters is that I‚Äôm
living a life that I enjoy. A life full of adventure, curiosity,
intimate connections and personal growth.
