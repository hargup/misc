Hi there ❤️ I’m Amanda.I’m a Kiwi, born and raised on warm beaches and meadows of sheep. I’m now living in San Francisco, getting my fill of inspiration and we-can-do-anything energy and crazy ambition. I worked at Ought for a while, building the LLM research tool, Elicit. I’m pretty proud of it.I care deeply about human wellbeing. All we have is our experience of being alive, and making our experience of being alive good feels like the goal underneath everything. I care about it at all levels: from showing up authentically and with kindness in each interaction, to orienting government and society around wellbeing, to embedding wellbeing in the development of ML & LLMs.
