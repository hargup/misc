Say It With Bots!Â¶
This tutorial was prepared for PyCon US 2020. Youâre free to follow along from
whereever you are.
This documentation lives at: https://github-app-tutorial.readthedocs.io/



Welcoming Contributions to Your ProjectÂ¶
In this tutorial weâll be building a GitHub bot that will automatically
greet contributors to your project. The bot will be built as a GitHub App which
can then be installed to your GitHub repositories.
We will be building a GitHub bot that can:

say thanks to the maintainer who installed your bot
say thanks to new contributors who made pull requests to your repository



About meÂ¶
My name is Mariatta. I live in Vancouver, Canada where I work as a Software Engineer
for Zapier. In my free time, I help with PyLadies globally and locally in Vancouver,
Iâm one of the co-founders of PyCascades conference, and I also contribute to open source.
Iâm a Python Core Developer. I help maintain Core Pythonâs GitHub bots:
bedevere and
miss-islington.
In this tutorial, weâll be using the same tools and technologies used by Core Pythonâs
team to build their bots.
If you have any feedback or questions about this tutorial, please file an issue.
