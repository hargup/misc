   Esteban TorresEngineer at SoundCloud The new Tower adds a lot of great features that help me go on with my day faster; like the ability to create pull-requests directly from the tool.    Dan CounsellCEO at Realmac Tower is the perfect Git client, I honestly wouldn’t want to use anything else.    Daniel SchutzsmithAmnesty International You should use Tower. It changed the game for me and made Git much more visual for me to understand.
