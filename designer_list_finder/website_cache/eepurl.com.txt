EepURL
We created EepURL as a trackable shortening service for Mailchimp's
      built-in Twitter integration. At the time, we
      opened it up to the public, because we felt there weren't enough
      monkey-based URL shorteners out there.
This service is no longer available for public use. We made
      this change in order to protect the reputation of the domain and high
      deliverability rates for Mailchimp customers who use EepURLs in their
      campaigns.
Existing URLs are still being redirected, and EepURL still works in
      the app.
If you're looking to build your own url shortener, take a moment to
      look at Shaun Inman's Lessn. Building your own url
      shortener is a good way to avoid having your links connected to a
      blocklisted domain name.
