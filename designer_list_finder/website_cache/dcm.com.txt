Partnering with inspired founders building category defining companies






 
We’re early stage investors
With over $4 billion in AUM, DCM has been focused on seed, series A, and series B for over 25 years. We've been fortunate to partner with 35 unicorns and counting.





 
We’re hands on and focused on value-add
We invest in a small handful of companies each year so we can be true partners to the founders we work with across areas including go-to-market, product, financial planning, and recruiting.





 
We’re a global team and platform
With a global, diverse, multicultural team across the US and Asia, we help founders we partner with access the best ideas, talent, and opportunities across the world.
