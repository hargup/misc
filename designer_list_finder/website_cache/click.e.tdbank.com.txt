Send Money With Zelle
Using Send Money with Zelle, enrolled customers with personal accounts and a TD Bank debit card can send money within minutes to almost anyone they know who has:
A U.S. mobile phone number or an e-mail address. And you don’t need their bank account number. Payments usually take minutes between friends and family enrolled in Zelle. Otherwise, figure one to three business days once your recipient enrolls.
You can also request money from a friend or family member. They'll get a message with easy instructions for paying you.
Splitting a lunch bill? Your money request can go to multiple contacts for easy collection.
Send Money with Zelle. It's quick and convenient, especially from the TD Bank mobile app.
