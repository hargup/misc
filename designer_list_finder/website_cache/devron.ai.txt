Devron enables you to access your data where it resides, and our team of experts will help build your first AI model in a matter of weeks.Get startedLearn more about the PlatformProblemCompanies Struggle to Gain Insight from their DataTraditional data science approaches require data to be consolidated into data stores before analysis and training of AI models. This duplication and movement of data results in delays in realizing value, increased risk, greater complexity, and higher costs.Heavily Distributed DataData is spread across systems, multiple clouds, departments, companies, and jurisdictionsâresulting in high data movement costs to bring it all together.Growing Privacy RestrictionsIncreasing privacy regulations around the globe are making it harder to access data for analysis.Data Sharing & Consolidation RisksData consolidation and third-party data sharing can increase the risk of cyberattacks, privacy leakage, and data lineage issues.Learn moreSolutionThe Devron PlatformDevron is a federated data science platform that enables teams to build and train AI models on distributed, heterogeneous, and private data where it resides.See how it worksLearn more about federated learningCore CapabilitiesDevron enables every step of the data science processâfrom data provisioning to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and pre-processing to model building and training.PrivatizeDevron empowers data owners to have complete control over their data. They can provision data for analysis, apply privacy controls, and grant or remove access to data.ExploreDevron allows data scientists to gain an understanding of remote and private datasets without revealing the raw information by providing the schema, statistics, and a synthetic sampling of the data.TransformUsing the information gathered during the EDA phase, data scientists can submit jobs for execution against multiple datasets, including building a data preparation pipeline to conduct data cleaning and feature engineering.TrainDevronâs proprietary algorithms enable data scientists to conduct machine learning over homogeneous and heterogeneous data sources, including importing existing models for federated training.The Devron DifferenceDevron is a faster, better outcome, and lower overhead approach to data science.Bypass Data MovementBypass lengthy and expensive data movement processes by bringing analytics to the data.Unlock More DataUnlock access to valuable, previously inaccessible datasets, discovering trapped innovation.Preserve PrivacyAnalyze data where it resides and without privacy leakage or lineage issues.Build Better ModelsHarness more data for advanced analytics to boast model accuracy, generalizability, & reliability.Accelerate InsightsGain data-driven insights in the near term and get on the path of continued iteration and value.Award WinningDevron was selected as the 2023 Best Machine Learning Company in the sixth annual AIÂ Breakthrough Awards program.Read moreWhat Our Customers & Partners Say About Us
