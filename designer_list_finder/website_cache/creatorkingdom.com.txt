My last 2 videos are in my top 3 performers…incredible










If you want fast growth on YouTube, listen up.

You fall into one of two buckets: you have a YouTube channel, or you want a YouTube channel.You know that video could elevate your brand to a new level. You know that YouTube can send thousands of customers your way. And you know that you can literally make a living on the platform if you get it right.But here’s the thing…Getting traction on YouTube isn’t easy.New channels can find it a struggle. And even if you’ve experienced the thrill of traction with your channel before, replicating the success repeatedly can be hard.Here’s what most people don’t know:
By following the correct blueprint, any channel can explode in popularity time and time again.
And almost every channel out there is shooting themselves in the foot with outdated tricks, a lack of vision, and money left on the table. Especially channels operated by ‘brands’. 
I want to help.
I’ve spent thousands of hours on YouTube:

Analyzing what works in the algorithm and why
Reverse engineering why top channels are succeeding
Spotting opportunities where huge channels leave money on the table
Diving into data to improve underperforming results

And I’ve been able to put a repeatable blueprint together based on what works.
I’ve consulted for some serious creators and marketers.
And I create and manage channels that consistently blow up with views that massively exceed subscriber numbers.
It can happen in just one video.
In May 2023, I uploaded a video on a channel with just 900 subscribers and reached 524,600 views, generating over $2,000 in ad revenue — despite the channel not being monetized at the time of upload.


My goal is to help your YouTube channel fly so high it needs a spacesuit.And almost every part of my playbook works for both new and existing channels.In Explode on YouTube, I’ll give you the framework you need to exploit the YouTube algorithm and see massive success with your brand.I’ll highlight mistakes that many huge channels are making.And I’ll even help you get greater performance out of videos you’ve already published.On top of that, you can join likeminded growth-oriented creators in the Creator Kingdom community. 
In the community, ask any question related to your idea, title, thumbnail, hook, video, or anything similar, and I’ll be on hand to provide specific insight for you. 
The long-term value of this is insane.
Look what happened to the Honest FBA channel…


They had uploaded over 200 videos but never reached 5,000 views. Their first video after joining Creator Kingdom reached 25,000 views, which is a lot in their niche. Update: the video now has 46,000 views.
All it took was some simple adjustments based on the Explode on YouTube blueprint, and a bit of input from the community.
Creator Kingdom will help you achieve realistic (but impressive) improvements in results based on a clear shift in mindset and tactics.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)




01
				What is Explode on YouTube?				




At its most basic, Explode on YouTube is a blueprint; a set of rules and guidance, and a repeatable process that you can follow to see success as a search-focused creator.
In addition to this, we have our Creator Kingdom community which acts as a real-time consultant for your channel. You can get input, tips and feedback for your own channel – even prior to upload, if you’re looking for improvement ideas before hitting publish.
You could describe Explode on YouTube as a ‘YouTube course’ as it has 35+ video lessons included, but I think ‘YouTube blueprint and community’ is a slightly more accurate description.




02
				When will membership be open?				




Doors are usually closed to Creator Kingdom. The best thing to do is sign up to be added to the waitlist, or join the newsletter, and you’ll be notified when I open access.




03
				Who is this course aimed at?				




Whilst channels of any style can find benefit from Explode on YouTube and the Creator Kingdom community, niche-focused creators and brands will find the biggest benefit — especially those with knowledge or experience of SEO. This includes those running or working for content sites, e-commerce businesses, and even search-focused consultants.




04
				Can you teach me how to make videos?				




Explode on YouTube focuses heavily on beating the algorithm. Whilst it does include tips about scripting, recording and editing, it does not teach you how to sit in front of a microphone and press record. Maybe in future!




05
				I already know a lot about the YouTube algorithm, will I find value in Explode on YouTube?				




I’m pretty confident that there are multiple hidden gems within Explode on YouTube that will make you think about things slightly differently or will reinforce certain things you were unsure about, even if you already know lots about the algorithm.
On top of this, you also get access to Creator Kingdom, so even if you know the algorithm inside out, you’ll find plenty of value in what is essentially real time consulting — post your thumbnails for feedback before it goes live, ask for input on ideas, and more.




06
				Do I have to show my face in videos?				




We’ve seen plenty of success making videos that do not show our face.




07
				How long will it take to complete the course?				




Because analysis paralysis is such a prevalent factor when it comes to YouTube channels, I focused heavily on only including the things you need to know. I also edited out every single pause (there are no “uhms” or “ahhs”, and there’s even almost no breathing) to make it as fast to consume as possible.
Explode on YouTube includes around 2 hours of efficient video content, a growing bank of thumbnail inspiration, and the Creator Kingdom community that could give you a lifetime of ongoing YouTube support.
I’m adding new lessons and resources every week outside of Explode on YouTube to continue improving your knowledge and results, and these are all included in your membership.




08
				What's the difference between Explode on YouTube and Creator Kingdom?				




Explode on YouTube is the name of the course aimed at helping you learn and thrive within the YouTube algorithm. Creator Kingdom is the name of our community, where likeminded creators learn and improve together.




09
				Do you offer YouTube consultancy?				




I am open to consultancy work for existing channels that want to get more out of what they’re doing. The ideal channel for working with me will have at least 50,000 subscribers. Email [email protected] if you’re interested.




10
				How is this different from other YouTube courses or free information?				




I can’t comment on what other courses are offering but I can communicate the clear value of Creator Kingdom:
In Explode on YouTube, you get a clear, concise, structured blueprint that is repeatable on any channel. The entire course is tailored to search-focused brands and creators. There’s no fluff and no information about things you don’t need to know.
Every video was 100% scripted and every single pause is edited out, meaning you get 2 hours of constant value in video form, plus a small number of additional text-based lessons.
As a teacher, I’m in the trenches making videos and consulting for fast-growing channels so I know what works first hand and have lots of data to back up my theories.
New lessons and resources are added weekly, continually increasing the value of your lifetime membership over time.
You also get access to Creator Kingdom, which is like having real-time, 24/7 consultants for your channel with the ability to get title, thumbnail and other feedback before or after a video goes live.




11
				Do you offer refunds?				




If you’re not happy with Explode on YouTube or Creator Kingdom for any reason, email me in the first 7 days and I’ll refund your purchase.
