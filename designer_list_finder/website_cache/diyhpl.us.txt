About this wiki
This is a wiki for open source hardware, do-it-yourself biohacking and practical transhumanism. The engineering teams behind this wiki can be found in the hplusroadmap IRC channel (logs). Projects are self-funded by the group.

Editing this wiki
Submit a pull request on github: https://github.com/kanzure/diyhpluswiki
Register to edit here and see other commands. You can also clone this wiki with git and push changes back:
git clone git://diyhpl.us/diyhpluswiki.git

Note to push changes you must push with your registered account:
git push username@diyhpl.us:/srv/git/diyhpluswiki.git master

git remote set-url origin username@diyhpl.us:/srv/git/diyhpluswiki.git

Now "git push" should work without debilitating complaint.
