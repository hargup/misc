It includes a web interface through which you can generate pull requests from automated end-to-end migrations, as well as an optional CLI offering local control.The two main tools used by Grit under the hood are GritQL, an intuitive and powerful query language for manipulating code using static analysis, and AI-powered transformations that allow our migrations to adapt seamlessly to the conventions of your codebase. Together, GritQL and AI transforms perform much of the repetitive work in modernizing outdated code, freeing you to spend time on building the software you want.ResourcesPattern libraryPatterns available out of the boxLanguage referenceReference documentation for GritCLI DocsDocumentation for the CLI
