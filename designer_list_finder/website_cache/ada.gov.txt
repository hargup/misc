          How to Report a Disability Rights Violation
        




          If you believe that you or someone else experienced unlawful discrimination, you can report a disability rights violation.
        





1


                    Report using our online form.
                  

                    By completing the online form, you can provide the details we need to understand what happened. You will receive a confirmation number and your report is immediately sent to our staff for review.
                  





2


                    We review your report.
                  

                    Teams that specialize in handling your type of issue will review it. If it needs to be forwarded to another team or agency, we will try to connect your complaint to the right group.
                  





3


                    We determine next steps and get back to you.
                  

                    Possible outcomes include: following up for more information, starting a mediation or investigation, directing you to another organization for further help, or informing you that we cannot help.
