						"Loops can surface the things that you may not even know are happening, which can be the most significant driver of your business. Loops give you a completely different perspective, which is powerful in the product world and often can point out something that, as a human, you may have never found."										
Jacob CrispHead of Product Growth, 18Birdies 











						"
Loops is a solution that needs to be in every growth product manager toolkit. Mostly because I think that one of its biggest values is how many experiments you can do. Loops helps us generate bunch of hypotheses and get really solid analyses on our data."									
Tabish GilaniSenior Product Manager, Replit 











						"Thanks to Loops' unique machine learning models, we were able to identify what sets up our users for success, and improve our long-term retention rate."										
Amir EngelProduct Analytics Director, Taboola 











						“With almost zero integration efforts and seamlessly, Loops managed to highlight hidden growth opportunities on our main KPIs”					
Michal Lupu Director of Product Management, Head of Product Growth at monday.com 











						"With tens of millions of users and multiple (sometimes contradicting) KPIs, Loops highlights actionable opportunities that help us in prioritizing what experiments will be the most impactful for us"
