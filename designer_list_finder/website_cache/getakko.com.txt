I‚Äôm so thrilled by this service. For only a couple dollars more than I‚Äôd been paying Verizon just for phone insurance, now all my devices are covered. I just completed a claim of my 6 year old MacBook Pro- which I‚Äôd spilled ramen all over. Service was super rapid‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd highly recommend AKKO.

What items are covered?

Your AKKO Plan covers just about any of your everyday personal items, from electronics to clothes to sports gear. Once registered, you can select one (1) phone + any 25 of your eligible belongings to load into your AKKO account for protection. Your items can be swapped out whenever you‚Äôd like.¬†ElectronicsPhones (limit of 1 per account), laptops, tablets, smartwatches, TVs, desktop computers, monitors, etc.Photography & Video EquipmentCameras, lenses, accessories, tripods, gimbals, etc.Audio & Music GearSpeakers, electronic music instruments, DJ equipment, headphones, musical instruments, etc.GamingVideo game consoles, controllers, peripherals, VR, etc.Personal Transportation (Non-Motorized)Bicycles, scooters, skateboards, hoverboards, unicycles¬†Sports & Recreational GearSkis, snowboards, golf clubs, tennis rackets, camping/climbing equipment, etc.Clothing & AccessoriesClothes, jackets, shoes, sunglasses, watches, jewelry, etc.Appliances (counter-top)Blenders, coffee makers, microwaves (counter-top), etc.School SuppliesTextbooks, backpacks, calculators, etc.NOTE: All plans are per individual and will only cover items owned by the plan-holder.

There are no quantity limits for other personal electronics and eligible items you want to add to your account.Multiple plans may be purchased at a discount with billing bundled together!







Why is this such a great deal?

In short, it‚Äôs because AKKO‚Äôs technology makes facilitating and managing protection for your stuff more efficient and less expensive. Typical insurers charge high fees on insurance and protection plans because of the work involved in processing policies and claims, plus the cost of advertising and marketing. AKKO is changing the game by providing reliable and affordable protection that‚Äôs simple and all-inclusive. We‚Äôve eliminated the need for you to spend money on the protection plans, extended warranties and insurance add-ons that retailers, phone companies and others use to pad their bottom lines. And because all your protection is in one place instead of being spread across multiple plans from multiple companies, the process of making a claim is drastically simpler.¬†







Doesn't my existing renters or homeowners insurance protect me already?

Renters or homeowners insurance will not protect your items against:Accidental damage (like drops)Cracked screensSpills & liquid submersionOf course, accidents like these happen. If you drop your phone without a protection plan, you‚Äôll be on your own for the screen replacement, which could cost up to $250. But with an AKKO plan, your coverage would nearly pay for itself within the first year!Renters and homeowners policies do cover theft; however, your policy will typically have a $250 ‚Äì $1,000 deductible. Furthermore, if you make a claim through those policies, your rates may increase because the claim gets reported and added to the equivalent of your ‚Äúcredit score‚Äù for insurance.So would it ever really be worth it to make a renters insurance claim if your $800 smartphone got stolen? Probably not. But with a low-deductible AKKO plan (deductibles as low as $29 and never more than $99), the entire cost of repairing or replacing your device will be covered! Equally importantly, your rates will never go up, no matter how many claims you make.Finally, as many people learn the hard way, auto insurance does not cover items stolen during vehicle break-ins; it will only cover damage to the vehicle itself. However, an AKKO plan will cover your items if they‚Äôre stolen or damaged in a break-in, and you‚Äôll still only pay your deductible.¬†Note: Integrated car accessories or audio equipment like speakers and decks are not covered; see What‚Äôs Not Covered in our FAQ for the full list of exclusions.

What is the deductible on an AKKO Plan?







The deductibles for phones on our phone-only protection plans or our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plan ranges from $29 ‚Äì $99 per claim based on the phone‚Äôs model. $99 is also the max deductible even for Theft or total replacement claims! (less than half the cost of most other protection providers.) Click here to view the deductibles for repairs/replacements on your specific phone make/model.


¬†


If you have one of our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plans which protects 1 phone + 25 other items, all other items besides your phone are subject to a $99 deductible for any incident of Accidental Damage or Theft.


¬†


This amount that is ‚Äúdeducted‚Äù from any reimbursement payout you receive exists so that individuals are still motivated to be careful with their stuff.


¬†


But with all of AKKO‚Äôs protection plans, we made sure to have the deductibles at least be set at easily affordable amounts for incidents of accidental damages, breakdowns, and theft, rather than the $150 ‚Äì $400 deductibles seen on many other protections plans for phones, laptops, and other electronics and personal items.


¬†





¬†


Note: Deductibles for lost or unrecoverable phones are equal to the deductible for theft on the same phone model, but there is a limit of only 1 lost/unrecoverable phone claim covered per 12 months. Location tracking must be enabled in the AKKO Mobile App and set to ‚ÄúAlways allow‚Äù on both iPhones and Android phones to be eligible for coverage for phones that are stolen, lost, or unrecoverable.

What is the coverage limit?







Phone-only Protection Plan Limits:
If you have a phone-only protection plan ($6-$12/mo), the limit of protection is capped at the replacement cost value of your phone at the time of your claim for each claim you file. But there is no limit on how many claims you may file or any lifetime limit that AKKO will pay out!


¬†


This means that no matter what, you will always be covered to get an exact replacement of your phone (down to the same make, model, color, technical specs, and carrier) anytime the device is damaged or stolen, no matter how many times it may be. There is no limit on the number of claims you may file and our plans are a subscription, so there is no ‚Äúterm length‚Äù (unlike a warranty which may be 1-3yrs). So your phone can be covered forever!



‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plan Limits:


For our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plans ($15/month for adults, $14 for students) there is a protection limit of $2,000 PER INCIDENT** for any item. There are no annual protection limits or a limit on the number of claims you may file. Additionally, all protection is still based on replacement cost value of your damaged/stolen items determined at the time of the claim. This means that if your laptop is stolen and costs $1,200 to replace at the time of the claim, you‚Äôll be reimbursed $1,200 (plus any applicable sales tax or shipping) less your deductible. You would not be reimbursed $2,000.


¬†


‚Äî


**$2,000 of protection PER INCIDENT means that if next week on Monday your laptop is stolen, up to the replacement value of your laptop is covered as long as that amount is less than $2,000.


¬†


If at another point in the same year you drop your tablet and the screen is smashed, up to the repair or replacement value cost of the tablet is covered as well as long as it‚Äôs less than $2,000.


¬†


But, there is not an annual limit of $2,000 which would be exhausted in case replacing your laptop cost $1,800 and replacing your tablet had cost $500.


This demonstrates PER INCIDENT protection and the per incident limit with an AKKO Plan is $2,000. There is not an annual limit.


¬†


HOWEVER, if during a single incident someone steals your entire backpack, filled with your laptop, and tablet, up to $2,000 total is covered to replace those items and any other contents of your backpack, plus the backpack itself. So if the combined replacement cost was above $2,000 for all these items, you would only have coverage up to $2,000 to be reimbursed.


¬†


Higher PER INCIDENT protection limits are available!


¬†


Once you‚Äôre registered, you can upgrade your plan to a PER INCIDENT limit as high as $10,000. But for a more common $3,000 ‚Äì $5,000 PER INCIDENT protection limit upgrade, it‚Äôs only a few more dollars per month üôÇ


¬†


The $2,000 of PER INCIDENT protection is more than enough for the majority of users based on our studies and the claims rates of currently protected AKKO users nationwide. But for those with more expensive items like a high-end laptop, or specialty gear like photography or music/audio equipment, the option to upgrade your limit is easily available. Simply contact us via the ‚Äúbilling‚Äù section of your account and we can upgrade your limit.


¬†


‚Äî


Other Limitations:


1. Coverage for jewelry, watches, rings, and other items consisting of gold, silver, or platinum or furs is limited $1,000.00 for any one Loss.


2. Coverage for bicycles is limited to $1,000.00.


3. Property in a personally owned automobile is covered, provided that the vehicle was locked and windows are fully closed at the time of theft and there was visible evidence of forced entry into the vehicle.


‚Äî


We re-state all this information under this separate Frequently Asked Question because sometimes users don‚Äôt click through all questions/answers and we want to make sure all prospective customers are fully informed üôÇ

Do I need my item receipts for coverage? What if I don't have them?







It is not a requirement to have receipts for the items you want to cover on your plan. While preferred, you can establish ‚Äúproof of ownership‚Äù of your items through other means.


¬†


For example, the pictures we have you take of your items when you add them to your account work great for providing this ‚Äúproof of ownership‚Äù!


¬†


Especially, for claims of accidental damage, copies of your purchase receipts are typically not requested.


¬†


For theft claims, the insurance company prefers to have you show a copy of your stolen items‚Äô purchase receipts. This is the quickest way for them to establish that you did in fact ‚Äúown‚Äù the items you‚Äôve claimed have been stolen.


¬†


However, if you no longer have copies of your receipts, your photos of the items uploaded to your account can usually suffice. As a best practice, keep track of your receipts! Have copies emailed to you when you purchase items, or take pictures of receipts and email them to yourself or make a habit of immediately uploading them to your AKKO account.


¬†


You can also try to contact the original seller/retailer you purchased items from as often they will have records going back a year or two of past transactions. You can try providing your name, phone number, email, or credit card number to try and track down a receipt for something you purchased.


¬†


For items you purchased used or through a 3rd party marketplace platform such as Craigslist, eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or OfferUp, request an email be sent to you by a seller stating the date you purchased an item, the amount paid, and what the item was. This can suffice as a purchase receipt! Including if you paid for items in cash.

Does my AKKO Plan cover lost items and lost phones?







If you lose one of your belongings, you‚Äôll need to evaluate the situation to determine whether it qualifies as theft or what‚Äôs called ‚Äúmysterious disappearance‚Äù (i.e., you simply misplaced your belonging and have no idea where it went, or it is unrecoverable such as falling into a lake).


¬†


Use tools like Find My iPhone or Google‚Äôs Find My Device to try and recover your phone; similar services exist to track down a missing laptop or tablet. Take screenshots or record evidence of your attempts to recover your phone to provide the most complete set of evidence you can with your claims.


¬†


To receive reimbursement for a stolen phone or other item, you must have location tracking fully enabled in the AKKO Mobile App. You will be prompted to enable all settings when you iniitally setup your account and add your phone to your plan. Ensure location tracking is set to ‚ÄúAlways allow‚Äù in your settings.

¬†


There is a waiting period of 30 days before any coverage under your membership plan begins (including protection against accidental damages, device malfunctions/failures, theft, or lost phones). In situations where ample photo/video evidence is available, and all photo verification steps have been completed for your item, this waiting period may be waived for cracked screen damages, but no other type of accidental damages, malfunctions, theft, or lost/unrecoverable phones.


¬†


Be sure to follow all instructions within your account for adding photos and information for your items.


¬†


Photos of phones should be uploaded using the phone‚Äôs own cameras (front and rear) to provide pictures of the front (screen) and back sides of the device by taking the photos in front of a mirror. Follow all instructions and examples provided in the AKKO Mobile or Web App. For tablets, a photo of the tablet‚Äôs ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù page in settings should also be provided by using another device (do not provide a screenshot) and the serial # of the device should be visible on the screen, as well as the entire front of the tablet being visible.

It is required to provide a photo of the serial # of the gaming device displayed on its own screen, or an external TV/display. This can be found in the gaming device‚Äôs settings. Do not just include photos of the gaming console itself if it has no screen, it must be plugged into a TV/display.























link
































Can I add items that are older or used to my protection plan?


YES!


The age or place you purchased your items does not matter. As long as an item is eligible for protection, regardless of its age or if you purchased it used from a store or individual, you can add it to your plan and have it protected through AKKO against accidental damages and theft.


See what items are eligible for protection here.


NOTE: for electronics, parts failures are only covered for devices that were purchased new and within 120 days after you enroll with AKKO (except for phones). Older items ARE still covered for accidental damage and theft as long as they are undamaged and fully functional! (see more info here)


¬†


RECEIPTS:


For items you purchased used or through a 3rd party marketplace platform such as Craigslist, eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or OfferUp, request an email be sent to you by a seller stating the date you purchased an item, the amount paid, and what the item was.


This can suffice as a receipt should you be asked to provide one during a claim. However, for any claim of theft, you must also be able to provide proof of purchase (such as a record of a PayPal or Venmo payment, or a copy of your credit card or bank statement showing the date and amount paid). Read more here about how purchase receipts are not required for coverage.

How Does Mechanical/Electrical Coverage Work for my Personal Electronics




Our AKKO Plan ( $15/month plan that protects 1 phone + 25 items) includes a mechanical/electrical components failure protection guarantee for all your portable electronic devices and TVs that lasts for 36 months from the date of purchase of each device.


Portable electronic devices and TVs you add to your AKKO account for this protection must have been purchased ‚Äúnew‚Äù by you either within the 120 days prior to your registration, or anytime after you registered your plan. You must upload your purchase receipt with each device you wish to have this protection to your AKKO account.


It‚Äôs basically like having FREE 3-year warranties on all of your portable electronic devices and TVs!


¬†


Terms:


For any of your portable electronic devices or TVs which already have an active warranty which covers mechanical/electrical component failures (either provided by the manufacturer of the device, a retailer/reseller, or third party) any claims pertaining to mechanical/electrical component failures would first go through your existing/included warranty.


¬†


After any existing warranty expires covering mechanical/electrical failures for your eligible devices, AKKO would take over for the remainder of the 36 month period starting from the date of purchase of the eligible portable electronic device or TV.


A portable electronic device is defined as any device which requires either an internal, or external battery to operate. In addition to portable electronics, this protection and these terms also apply to TVs. All claims are still subject to your plan‚Äôs standard service fees/deductibles.


This special protection ends for your devices if you cancel your plan with AKKO and cannot be resumed even if you choose to then re-enroll with AKKO at a later point in time.

What is the deductible on an AKKO Plan?







The deductibles for phones on our phone-only protection plans or our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plan ranges from $29 ‚Äì $99 per claim based on the phone‚Äôs model. $99 is also the max deductible even for Theft or total replacement claims! (less than half the cost of most other protection providers.) Click here to view the deductibles for repairs/replacements on your specific phone make/model.


¬†


If you have one of our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plans which protects 1 phone + 25 other items, all other items besides your phone are subject to a $99 deductible for any incident of Accidental Damage or Theft.


¬†


This amount that is ‚Äúdeducted‚Äù from any reimbursement payout you receive exists so that individuals are still motivated to be careful with their stuff.


¬†


But with all of AKKO‚Äôs protection plans, we made sure to have the deductibles at least be set at easily affordable amounts for incidents of accidental damages, breakdowns, and theft, rather than the $150 ‚Äì $400 deductibles seen on many other protections plans for phones, laptops, and other electronics and personal items.


¬†





¬†


Note: Deductibles for lost or unrecoverable phones are equal to the deductible for theft on the same phone model, but there is a limit of only 1 lost/unrecoverable phone claim covered per 12 months. Location tracking must be enabled in the AKKO Mobile App and set to ‚ÄúAlways allow‚Äù on both iPhones and Android phones to be eligible for coverage for phones that are stolen, lost, or unrecoverable.























link
































What is the coverage limit?







Phone-only Protection Plan Limits:
If you have a phone-only protection plan ($6-$12/mo), the limit of protection is capped at the replacement cost value of your phone at the time of your claim for each claim you file. But there is no limit on how many claims you may file or any lifetime limit that AKKO will pay out!


¬†


This means that no matter what, you will always be covered to get an exact replacement of your phone (down to the same make, model, color, technical specs, and carrier) anytime the device is damaged or stolen, no matter how many times it may be. There is no limit on the number of claims you may file and our plans are a subscription, so there is no ‚Äúterm length‚Äù (unlike a warranty which may be 1-3yrs). So your phone can be covered forever!



‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plan Limits:


For our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plans ($15/month for adults, $14 for students) there is a protection limit of $2,000 PER INCIDENT** for any item. There are no annual protection limits or a limit on the number of claims you may file. Additionally, all protection is still based on replacement cost value of your damaged/stolen items determined at the time of the claim. This means that if your laptop is stolen and costs $1,200 to replace at the time of the claim, you‚Äôll be reimbursed $1,200 (plus any applicable sales tax or shipping) less your deductible. You would not be reimbursed $2,000.


¬†


‚Äî


**$2,000 of protection PER INCIDENT means that if next week on Monday your laptop is stolen, up to the replacement value of your laptop is covered as long as that amount is less than $2,000.


¬†


If at another point in the same year you drop your tablet and the screen is smashed, up to the repair or replacement value cost of the tablet is covered as well as long as it‚Äôs less than $2,000.


¬†


But, there is not an annual limit of $2,000 which would be exhausted in case replacing your laptop cost $1,800 and replacing your tablet had cost $500.


This demonstrates PER INCIDENT protection and the per incident limit with an AKKO Plan is $2,000. There is not an annual limit.


¬†


HOWEVER, if during a single incident someone steals your entire backpack, filled with your laptop, and tablet, up to $2,000 total is covered to replace those items and any other contents of your backpack, plus the backpack itself. So if the combined replacement cost was above $2,000 for all these items, you would only have coverage up to $2,000 to be reimbursed.


¬†


Higher PER INCIDENT protection limits are available!


¬†


Once you‚Äôre registered, you can upgrade your plan to a PER INCIDENT limit as high as $10,000. But for a more common $3,000 ‚Äì $5,000 PER INCIDENT protection limit upgrade, it‚Äôs only a few more dollars per month üôÇ


¬†


The $2,000 of PER INCIDENT protection is more than enough for the majority of users based on our studies and the claims rates of currently protected AKKO users nationwide. But for those with more expensive items like a high-end laptop, or specialty gear like photography or music/audio equipment, the option to upgrade your limit is easily available. Simply contact us via the ‚Äúbilling‚Äù section of your account and we can upgrade your limit.


¬†


‚Äî


Other Limitations:


1. Coverage for jewelry, watches, rings, and other items consisting of gold, silver, or platinum or furs is limited $1,000.00 for any one Loss.


2. Coverage for bicycles is limited to $1,000.00.


3. Property in a personally owned automobile is covered, provided that the vehicle was locked and windows are fully closed at the time of theft and there was visible evidence of forced entry into the vehicle.


‚Äî


We re-state all this information under this separate Frequently Asked Question because sometimes users don‚Äôt click through all questions/answers and we want to make sure all prospective customers are fully informed üôÇ

Do I need my item receipts for coverage? What if I don't have them?







It is not a requirement to have receipts for the items you want to cover on your plan. While preferred, you can establish ‚Äúproof of ownership‚Äù of your items through other means.


¬†


For example, the pictures we have you take of your items when you add them to your account work great for providing this ‚Äúproof of ownership‚Äù!


¬†


Especially, for claims of accidental damage, copies of your purchase receipts are typically not requested.


¬†


For theft claims, the insurance company prefers to have you show a copy of your stolen items‚Äô purchase receipts. This is the quickest way for them to establish that you did in fact ‚Äúown‚Äù the items you‚Äôve claimed have been stolen.


¬†


However, if you no longer have copies of your receipts, your photos of the items uploaded to your account can usually suffice. As a best practice, keep track of your receipts! Have copies emailed to you when you purchase items, or take pictures of receipts and email them to yourself or make a habit of immediately uploading them to your AKKO account.


¬†


You can also try to contact the original seller/retailer you purchased items from as often they will have records going back a year or two of past transactions. You can try providing your name, phone number, email, or credit card number to try and track down a receipt for something you purchased.


¬†


For items you purchased used or through a 3rd party marketplace platform such as Craigslist, eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or OfferUp, request an email be sent to you by a seller stating the date you purchased an item, the amount paid, and what the item was. This can suffice as a purchase receipt! Including if you paid for items in cash.

Does AKKO cover damage to my car or motor vehicle? What about items inside my car or motor vehicle?

NO. This coverage does not apply to any damage or theft or loss that affects your car or motor vehicle (such as a street scooter or motorcycle) or any items incorporated or mounted/installed on to the exterior/interior of your vehicle (like cameras/GPS devices). You‚Äôd have to go through your Auto-Insurance for recovering losses.

However, your protection with AKKO does apply to items inside your car that are Damaged or Stolen so long as you provide proof of forced entry into the vehicle indicating that your doors/windows/trunk/cargo bags were closed and locked on the vehicle (such as damaged/broken doors or windows).

Just as with any other claims for Theft, you must also provide a copy of your filed police report if items are stolen from your vehicle during a break-in and your phone must have location tracking fully enabled in the AKKO Mobile App with location tracking set to ‚ÄúAlways allow‚Äù in your settings.
















link
































Does my AKKO Plan cover lost items and lost phones?







If you lose one of your belongings, you‚Äôll need to evaluate the situation to determine whether it qualifies as theft or what‚Äôs called ‚Äúmysterious disappearance‚Äù (i.e., you simply misplaced your belonging and have no idea where it went, or it is unrecoverable such as falling into a lake).


¬†


Use tools like Find My iPhone or Google‚Äôs Find My Device to try and recover your phone; similar services exist to track down a missing laptop or tablet. Take screenshots or record evidence of your attempts to recover your phone to provide the most complete set of evidence you can with your claims.


¬†


To receive reimbursement for a stolen phone or other item, you must have location tracking fully enabled in the AKKO Mobile App. You will be prompted to enable all settings when you iniitally setup your account and add your phone to your plan. Ensure location tracking is set to ‚ÄúAlways allow‚Äù in your settings.


¬†


If you have an Android device:


Make sure Find My Device is also working and enabled. Go to your web browser, search for ‚ÄúFind My Device‚Äù and click the first result. Make sure you can see the device on a map displaying ‚Äúlast known location‚Äù along with the device name, make, and model.


¬†


If you have an iPhone:


The ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù app on iOS does not provide a history of your device‚Äôs location, which can help provide proof of theft for your claim or help you try and recover it. Instead, download the Google Maps app and be sure it is set to allow location access at all times. You can verify that your Google Maps timeline is available by checking here: https://www.google.com/maps/timeline


¬†


You will have to have location tracking fully enabled in the AKKO Mobile App if your phone or another item is stolen and you wish to seek reimbursement for a replacement under your plan‚Äôs reimbursement benefits.


¬†


The protection you get with one of AKKO‚Äôs protection plans will cover theft of any item if indicated in your plan overview and inclusions, but it will only cover one (1) incident of ‚Äúmysterious disappearance‚Äù of a phone per 12 month period and be subject to the same replacement/theft deductible for your phone model as indicated in your account or on AKKO‚Äôs website under all other phone deductibles.

Why is an AKKO Plan better than renters' or homeowners' insurance?

Renter‚Äôs insurance (from Lemonade, Jetty, or other established insurance providers) typically covers losses to your property from damage or theft ONLY when you‚Äôre at home and DOES NOT cover Accidental Damage like a dropped phone or spilling coffee on your laptop.
Accidental Damage like Cracked Screens, Spills, and Drops are more than 12x as likely to happen than the losses that occur which Renter‚Äôs Policies will even cover‚Ä¶
Additionally, the deductibles on a Renter‚Äôs Policy for losses from damage like fires, floods, or a break-in are usually $250-$1,000‚Ä¶
That‚Äôs WAY higher than our $99 deductibles for ANY claim filed. Whether it‚Äôs Accidental Damage, or Theft, Vandalism, or even a Fire/Flood, or natural disaster.
Plus, the cost of your renter‚Äôs or homeowners insurance coverage may also increase when you do file a claim‚Ä¶
Whereas the coverage you get when signing up with AKKO will never increase because you file a claim!
















link
































Why is an AKKO Plan such a great deal?

The short answer: because AKKO is using technology to make facilitating and managing protection for your stuff more efficient and less costly. Typical insurers charge really high¬†fees on the insurance and protection plans you buy because of the work involved in processing policies and claims.
At AKKO, we‚Äôre changing that ‚Äì enabling our customers to get comprehensive, affordable and straightforward protection. We‚Äôre ending the need to buy protection plans or insurance at the point of sale every time you get something new. Just add it to your AKKO plan, and you‚Äôre covered!
















link
































Why have I never heard of AKKO before? Are you legit?







AKKO is a startup! But we are indeed a legitimate and insured U.S. corporation with backing from an ‚ÄúA‚Äù Rated insurer.


¬†


AKKO was founded in 2018 initially approved for covering college students only with our unique protection plan that protects all of your eligible personal items for only one simple and affordable monthly fee.


¬†


After working with a few large college organizations, AKKO began the process to get the same amazing protection plan approved to sell to anyone.


¬†


At the start of 2020, we soft-launched our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plan! And now we‚Äôre trying to spread the word fast so people can start protecting the stuff they care about and rely on in an affordable and easy way.


¬†


We also added our Phone-only protection plans in November 2020 for those who are only looking for phone protection that‚Äôs simple and affordable.


AKKO‚Äôs primary focus is on making protection easy and pleasant for our members.


¬†


When accidents or theft happens, the last thing you as the customer should have to deal with is MORE negativity and frustration‚Ä¶


¬†


With AKKO, there are:





No hidden fees




No long lists of protection exclusions




No restrictions on how old the stuff is you want to protect (or whether you purchased it used)




No long phone waits when you file a claim or need assistance




and no weeks or months long waits to actually get reimbursement for your losses‚Ä¶





¬†


We‚Äôre doing things different and are excited for you to try out our platform, get to know our company and team, and be able to say ‚ÄúThank goodness I had AKKO‚Ä¶‚Äù when life‚Äôs bad and ‚Äúoops‚Äù moments happen to you. üôÇ


¬†

link
































Can I sign up for an AKKO Plan to cover repairs for phones or electronics that are already damaged?

No. 
Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not how protection plans work. If you have any items that are currently broken (cracked phone screen, water-damaged laptop, etc.), they are not eligible to be added to an AKKO Plan and will not be repaired or replaced by us.
For an item to be eligible for protection, you must:
1. Have an active plan with AKKO
2. Have the item‚Äôs information uploaded to your account along with pictures of it in working and undamaged condition. This means that you‚Äôve taken photos of the item in accordance with all the instructions we provide when you‚Äôre adding an item to your account.
Then, if something happens to any of your items in the future, they‚Äôre protected!
If you do have an item that‚Äôs already damaged in any way, it will need to be repaired fully to be eligible for protection under our plans.
Even though it may be too late for the items you‚Äôve damaged already, signing up for an AKKO plan today will ensure that you‚Äôre covered in case misfortune (or clumsiness) strikes again!
















link
































Does an AKKO Plan protect my phone and other items when I travel or study abroad?


YES! As long as you‚Äôre a U.S. or Canadian resident with our protection, your items are fully protected when you travel or are living/staying abroad. ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD!


The same procedures apply for filing claims if any of your items are affected by accidental damage or theft while you are abroad. Check our article here on how claims work.


AKKO will send you the funds for your claim payout electronically so you can get a repair or replacement where you are.


Please note that if your claim requires an item replacement, funds will be sent to you equal to the cost of replacement for your item based upon U.S. prices.

















link
































How can I upgrade my coverage to a higher limit?

To upgrade your coverage, just email us at [email¬†protected] for help with changing your coverage plan. We‚Äôll update your plan and confirm the changes with the insurance company so that your plan can have a higher coverage limit to accommodate your more expensive items, or a higher per incident limit for your stuff.
For Student Plans, we have coverage limits that range from $2,000 to $6,000 per incident in increments of $1,000, all with a $99 deductible.
For Adult Plans, we currently offer plans with per incident coverage limits of $2,000 ‚Äì $6,000 in increments of $1,000, all with a $99 deductible.
If you want to protect multiple phones on a single plan, you may need to upgrade your coverage with an add-on or purchase additional AKKO Plans.
















link
































When does my coverage take effect?








Your protection begins at 12:01 a.m. Standard Time at the location of your property the day after your account is created and payment is current and activation is completed.


¬†


There is a waiting period of 30 days before any coverage under your membership plan begins (including protection against accidental damages, device malfunctions/failures, theft, or lost phones). In situations where ample photo/video evidence is available, and all photo verification steps have been completed for your item, this waiting period may be waived for cracked screen damages, but no other type of accidental damages, malfunctions, theft, or lost/unrecoverable phones.


¬†


Be sure to follow all instructions within your account for adding photos and information for your items.


¬†


Photos of phones should be uploaded using the phone‚Äôs own cameras (front and rear) to provide pictures of the front (screen) and back sides of the device by taking the photos in front of a mirror. Follow all instructions and examples provided in the AKKO Mobile or Web App. For tablets, a photo of the tablet‚Äôs ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù page in settings should also be provided by using another device (do not provide a screenshot) and the serial # of the device should be visible on the screen, as well as the entire front of the tablet being visible.


¬†


Photos of laptops and computers should be taken by including a photo of the device with the screen powered on and also displaying the ‚Äúabout‚Äù page showing the specs and serial # of the computer. The entire screen should be visible in this photo.

It is required to provide a photo of the serial # of the gaming device displayed on its own screen, or an external TV/display. This can be found in the gaming device‚Äôs settings. Do not just include photos of the gaming console itself if it has no screen, it must be plugged into a TV/display.























link
































Can I add items that are older or used to my protection plan?


YES!


The age or place you purchased your items does not matter. As long as an item is eligible for protection, regardless of its age or if you purchased it used from a store or individual, you can add it to your plan and have it protected through AKKO against accidental damages and theft.


See what items are eligible for protection here.


NOTE: for electronics, parts failures are only covered for devices that were purchased new and within 120 days after you enroll with AKKO (except for phones). Older items ARE still covered for accidental damage and theft as long as they are undamaged and fully functional! (see more info here)


¬†


RECEIPTS:


For items you purchased used or through a 3rd party marketplace platform such as Craigslist, eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or OfferUp, request an email be sent to you by a seller stating the date you purchased an item, the amount paid, and what the item was.


This can suffice as a receipt should you be asked to provide one during a claim. However, for any claim of theft, you must also be able to provide proof of purchase (such as a record of a PayPal or Venmo payment, or a copy of your credit card or bank statement showing the date and amount paid). Read more here about how purchase receipts are not required for coverage.

















link
































Can I cover a phone that is leased or financed?


Yes! You may cover any phone which is yours and in your possession. You do not need to have your phone paid-in-full.


¬†


Many of our customers have phones paid for on installment plans through their cellular carriers or other retailers.


¬†


When you register, the same process applies for adding your phone to your account. For uploading a receipt, just download a PDF or take a screenshot of your most recent bill/statement from the cellular carrier or retailer showing your installment payment and the type of device.


¬†


Please note that for any claim on a leased/financed phone that requires replacement of the device, the remaining balance you owe for the device will have to be fully paid off before you can receive your remaining claim reimbursement.

What is the deductible on an AKKO Plan?







The deductibles for phones on our phone-only protection plans or our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plan ranges from $29 ‚Äì $99 per claim based on the phone‚Äôs model. $99 is also the max deductible even for Theft or total replacement claims! (less than half the cost of most other protection providers.) Click here to view the deductibles for repairs/replacements on your specific phone make/model.


¬†


If you have one of our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plans which protects 1 phone + 25 other items, all other items besides your phone are subject to a $99 deductible for any incident of Accidental Damage or Theft.


¬†


This amount that is ‚Äúdeducted‚Äù from any reimbursement payout you receive exists so that individuals are still motivated to be careful with their stuff.


¬†


But with all of AKKO‚Äôs protection plans, we made sure to have the deductibles at least be set at easily affordable amounts for incidents of accidental damages, breakdowns, and theft, rather than the $150 ‚Äì $400 deductibles seen on many other protections plans for phones, laptops, and other electronics and personal items.


¬†





¬†


Note: Deductibles for lost or unrecoverable phones are equal to the deductible for theft on the same phone model, but there is a limit of only 1 lost/unrecoverable phone claim covered per 12 months. Location tracking must be enabled in the AKKO Mobile App and set to ‚ÄúAlways allow‚Äù on both iPhones and Android phones to be eligible for coverage for phones that are stolen, lost, or unrecoverable.

Does my AKKO Plan cover lost items and lost phones?







If you lose one of your belongings, you‚Äôll need to evaluate the situation to determine whether it qualifies as theft or what‚Äôs called ‚Äúmysterious disappearance‚Äù (i.e., you simply misplaced your belonging and have no idea where it went, or it is unrecoverable such as falling into a lake).


¬†


Use tools like Find My iPhone or Google‚Äôs Find My Device to try and recover your phone; similar services exist to track down a missing laptop or tablet. Take screenshots or record evidence of your attempts to recover your phone to provide the most complete set of evidence you can with your claims.


¬†


To receive reimbursement for a stolen phone or other item, you must have location tracking fully enabled in the AKKO Mobile App. You will be prompted to enable all settings when you iniitally setup your account and add your phone to your plan. Ensure location tracking is set to ‚ÄúAlways allow‚Äù in your settings.


¬†


If you have an Android device:


Make sure Find My Device is also working and enabled. Go to your web browser, search for ‚ÄúFind My Device‚Äù and click the first result. Make sure you can see the device on a map displaying ‚Äúlast known location‚Äù along with the device name, make, and model.


¬†


If you have an iPhone:


The ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù app on iOS does not provide a history of your device‚Äôs location, which can help provide proof of theft for your claim or help you try and recover it. Instead, download the Google Maps app and be sure it is set to allow location access at all times. You can verify that your Google Maps timeline is available by checking here: https://www.google.com/maps/timeline


¬†


You will have to have location tracking fully enabled in the AKKO Mobile App if your phone or another item is stolen and you wish to seek reimbursement for a replacement under your plan‚Äôs reimbursement benefits.


¬†


The protection you get with one of AKKO‚Äôs protection plans will cover theft of any item if indicated in your plan overview and inclusions, but it will only cover one (1) incident of ‚Äúmysterious disappearance‚Äù of a phone per 12 month period and be subject to the same replacement/theft deductible for your phone model as indicated in your account or on AKKO‚Äôs website under all other phone deductibles.

Can I add multiple phones to my AKKO Plan?

All accounts may have up to one (1) phone on them. To add more phones, you must purchase additional plans ‚Äì either phone-only or an ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plan.

What's the process for filing a claim? How long will it take for my repair or replacement?


AKKO is all about making claims easy and fast for you!


¬†


Here is the process for claims:





Login to your AKKO account and file your claim from your phone or the web.




A team member will reach out to you the same or next day to collect any applicable extra information, or to direct you to a nearby repair provider.




Repairs: If your item is in need of repairs, AKKO will either pay you or a repair shop for repairs for your item(s). If funds are paid to you directly, you can receive funds via PayPal, or a wire transfer initiated the same-day as claim approval. (many of our repair claims, such as cracked phone screens, get fully resolved within 24hrs!)




Replacements: If your item is in need of total replacement (unrepairable or stolen), AKKO will send you a payout equal to the replacement value, or can also have a replacement item sent straight to you.





Notes:





Your deductible is subtracted from any claim payouts. (for example, if your screen repair is $158 after tax, and the repair deductible for your phone is $49, you would receive a payout of $109)




Claims of theft will take longer to resolve than damage claims. Police reports and proof of purchase are required and copies must be submitted to our team, the time to receive a report may vary based on where you live.




If you have Apple devices which a local repair provider is not able to service, then you can get them taken care of at an Apple Store, we WILL NOT force you to send us your Apple devices to get repaired. Our goal is to get your items fixed/replaced ASAP





¬†


How do we determine the replacement value of your items?


If your item(s) are too extensively damaged (or were stolen) and you require a replacement device or item, our team member will find the replacement value of the item by looking at the cost of an available refurbished replacement of the same make/model/year/specs then send you a reimbursement payout.


¬†


For example, if your iPhone X was stolen or completely destroyed, we would find the value of a refurbished iPhone X and your payout would be the cost of the replacement, plus sales tax if applicable, then subtracting your plan‚Äôs deductible ($29-$99 based on your phone, or for non-phone items $99 on our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plan for adults and students.


¬†


AKKO will not determine the value of your item based on what used iPhone X phones or other items are being sold for by random individuals online. Replacement values are only determined based off items sold by businesses. You also will not receive a payout based on the value you initially paid for your phone or any other affected item when it was new.


¬†


The same process applies to claims for other electronics and personal items on your plan which are eligible for protection.


¬†


¬†


THEFT: For the theft of a phone or any of your items to be eligible for reimbursement, you must have device location tracking enabled in the AKKO Mobile App.

















link
































If my phone or other items need to be completely replaced, how much money do I get to do so?







Replacements:
If your items are too extensively damaged (or were stolen) and you require a replacement device or item, we offer a few flexible options to best suit your preference!


1) We can send you instant cash (via PayPal, Zelle, or Check) for a refurbished replacement of your device.
2) If no replacement value can be found for your item, we would send you the funds for the value of a newer model/available.
3) Instead of cash, we can send you a refurbished device listed in very good condition.
4) Instead of cash, we can send you a newer/different device model and you pay the difference for any upgraded model.


¬†


As a general note, we find the replacement value of the item by looking at the cost of refurbished items of the same make/model/year. Check out Backmarket.com and Swappa.com to see the present value of your phone model or other devices.


¬†


For example, if your iPhone X was stolen or completely destroyed, we would find the value of a refurbished iPhone X and your payout would be the cost of the replacement, plus sales tax if applicable, then subtracting your plan‚Äôs deductible ($29-$99 based upon your plan and item). This is in reference to option ‚Äú1)‚Äù above if you wanted instant cash.


¬†


We will not base the value of your item off of what used iPhone X phones are being sold for by random individuals on a site like OfferUp or Craigslist. You also will not receive a payout based on the value you initially paid for the phone when it was new, unless no replacement can be found.


¬†


The same process applies to claims for other electronics and personal items on your plan which are eligible for coverage.























link
































When does my coverage take effect?








Your protection begins at 12:01 a.m. Standard Time at the location of your property the day after your account is created and payment is current and activation is completed.


¬†


There is a waiting period of 30 days before any coverage under your membership plan begins (including protection against accidental damages, device malfunctions/failures, theft, or lost phones). In situations where ample photo/video evidence is available, and all photo verification steps have been completed for your item, this waiting period may be waived for cracked screen damages, but no other type of accidental damages, malfunctions, theft, or lost/unrecoverable phones.


¬†


Be sure to follow all instructions within your account for adding photos and information for your items.


¬†


Photos of phones should be uploaded using the phone‚Äôs own cameras (front and rear) to provide pictures of the front (screen) and back sides of the device by taking the photos in front of a mirror. Follow all instructions and examples provided in the AKKO Mobile or Web App. For tablets, a photo of the tablet‚Äôs ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù page in settings should also be provided by using another device (do not provide a screenshot) and the serial # of the device should be visible on the screen, as well as the entire front of the tablet being visible.


¬†


Photos of laptops and computers should be taken by including a photo of the device with the screen powered on and also displaying the ‚Äúabout‚Äù page showing the specs and serial # of the computer. The entire screen should be visible in this photo.


¬†


Photos of TVs should also be taken where the screen is powered on and displaying video/image. It is required to provide a photo of the serial # displayed on the TV‚Äôs screen which can be accessed in the TV‚Äôs settings.


¬†


For gaming consoles, be sure to include photos that show the device powered on with image/video visible on a display. It is required to provide a photo of the serial # of the gaming device displayed on its own screen, or an external TV/display. This can be found in the gaming device‚Äôs settings. Do not just include photos of the gaming console itself if it has no screen, it must be plugged into a TV/display.























link
































Can I add items that are older or used to my protection plan?


YES!


The age or place you purchased your items does not matter. As long as an item is eligible for protection, regardless of its age or if you purchased it used from a store or individual, you can add it to your plan and have it protected through AKKO against accidental damages and theft.


See what items are eligible for protection here.


NOTE: for electronics, parts failures are only covered for devices that were purchased new and within 120 days after you enroll with AKKO (except for phones). Older items ARE still covered for accidental damage and theft as long as they are undamaged and fully functional! (see more info here)


¬†


RECEIPTS:


For items you purchased used or through a 3rd party marketplace platform such as Craigslist, eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or OfferUp, request an email be sent to you by a seller stating the date you purchased an item, the amount paid, and what the item was.


This can suffice as a receipt should you be asked to provide one during a claim. However, for any claim of theft, you must also be able to provide proof of purchase (such as a record of a PayPal or Venmo payment, or a copy of your credit card or bank statement showing the date and amount paid). Read more here about how purchase receipts are not required for coverage.

















link
































Can I cover a phone that is leased or financed?


Yes! You may cover any phone which is yours and in your possession. You do not need to have your phone paid-in-full.


¬†


Many of our customers have phones paid for on installment plans through their cellular carriers or other retailers.


¬†


When you register, the same process applies for adding your phone to your account. For uploading a receipt, just download a PDF or take a screenshot of your most recent bill/statement from the cellular carrier or retailer showing your installment payment and the type of device.


¬†


Please note that for any claim on a leased/financed phone that requires replacement of the device, the remaining balance you owe for the device will have to be fully paid off before you can receive your remaining claim reimbursement.

















link
































Are unlocked phones covered?


Yes! It does not matter what carrier you use or if your phone is unlocked or financed.


¬†


No matter which plan you choose, your unlocked phone will be protected against Accidental Damage & Theft.


¬†


When you register, the same process applies for adding your phone to your account. You will take pictures of its front and back to verify its working and undamaged condition.


¬†

What if I want to sign up for AKKO but my phone is already broken?


NO. Unfortunately that‚Äôs not how protection plans work‚Ä¶ üôÅ


¬†


If you have any items that are currently broken (cracked phone screen, water damaged laptop, etc.) then you CAN NOT sign up and then file a claim to have those items fixed.


¬†


For an item to be eligible for protection, you must:


¬†


1) have an active plan with AKKO


¬†


2) have the item‚Äôs information uploaded to your account along with pictures of it in working and un-damaged condition. This means that you‚Äôve taken photos of the item in accordance with all instructions within your account based on the item you are adding.


¬†


Then, if something happens to any of your items in the future, they‚Äôre protected!


¬†


If you do have an item that‚Äôs currently already damaged, it will need to be repaired fully to be eligible for protection under our plans. If you do have any items currently damaged, get them fixed and then be sure to sign up for either our Phone-only protection plan or our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plan now so that the next time some mishap happens, we‚Äôll cover it!

What is the coverage limit?







Phone-only Protection Plan Limits:
If you have a phone-only protection plan ($6-$12/mo), the limit of protection is capped at the replacement cost value of your phone at the time of your claim for each claim you file. But there is no limit on how many claims you may file or any lifetime limit that AKKO will pay out!


¬†


This means that no matter what, you will always be covered to get an exact replacement of your phone (down to the same make, model, color, technical specs, and carrier) anytime the device is damaged or stolen, no matter how many times it may be. There is no limit on the number of claims you may file and our plans are a subscription, so there is no ‚Äúterm length‚Äù (unlike a warranty which may be 1-3yrs). So your phone can be covered forever!



‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plan Limits:


For our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plans ($15/month for adults, $14 for students) there is a protection limit of $2,000 PER INCIDENT** for any item. There are no annual protection limits or a limit on the number of claims you may file. Additionally, all protection is still based on replacement cost value of your damaged/stolen items determined at the time of the claim. This means that if your laptop is stolen and costs $1,200 to replace at the time of the claim, you‚Äôll be reimbursed $1,200 (plus any applicable sales tax or shipping) less your deductible. You would not be reimbursed $2,000.


¬†


‚Äî


**$2,000 of protection PER INCIDENT means that if next week on Monday your laptop is stolen, up to the replacement value of your laptop is covered as long as that amount is less than $2,000.


¬†


If at another point in the same year you drop your tablet and the screen is smashed, up to the repair or replacement value cost of the tablet is covered as well as long as it‚Äôs less than $2,000.


¬†


But, there is not an annual limit of $2,000 which would be exhausted in case replacing your laptop cost $1,800 and replacing your tablet had cost $500.


This demonstrates PER INCIDENT protection and the per incident limit with an AKKO Plan is $2,000. There is not an annual limit.


¬†


HOWEVER, if during a single incident someone steals your entire backpack, filled with your laptop, and tablet, up to $2,000 total is covered to replace those items and any other contents of your backpack, plus the backpack itself. So if the combined replacement cost was above $2,000 for all these items, you would only have coverage up to $2,000 to be reimbursed.


¬†


Higher PER INCIDENT protection limits are available!


¬†


Once you‚Äôre registered, you can upgrade your plan to a PER INCIDENT limit as high as $10,000. But for a more common $3,000 ‚Äì $5,000 PER INCIDENT protection limit upgrade, it‚Äôs only a few more dollars per month üôÇ


¬†


The $2,000 of PER INCIDENT protection is more than enough for the majority of users based on our studies and the claims rates of currently protected AKKO users nationwide. But for those with more expensive items like a high-end laptop, or specialty gear like photography or music/audio equipment, the option to upgrade your limit is easily available. Simply contact us via the ‚Äúbilling‚Äù section of your account and we can upgrade your limit.


¬†


‚Äî


Other Limitations:


1. Coverage for jewelry, watches, rings, and other items consisting of gold, silver, or platinum or furs is limited $1,000.00 for any one Loss.


2. Coverage for bicycles is limited to $1,000.00.


3. Property in a personally owned automobile is covered, provided that the vehicle was locked and windows are fully closed at the time of theft and there was visible evidence of forced entry into the vehicle.


‚Äî


We re-state all this information under this separate Frequently Asked Question because sometimes users don‚Äôt click through all questions/answers and we want to make sure all prospective customers are fully informed üôÇ

Do I need my item receipts for coverage? What if I don't have them?







It is not a requirement to have receipts for the items you want to cover on your plan. While preferred, you can establish ‚Äúproof of ownership‚Äù of your items through other means.


¬†


For example, the pictures we have you take of your items when you add them to your account work great for providing this ‚Äúproof of ownership‚Äù!


¬†


Especially, for claims of accidental damage, copies of your purchase receipts are typically not requested.


¬†


For theft claims, the insurance company prefers to have you show a copy of your stolen items‚Äô purchase receipts. This is the quickest way for them to establish that you did in fact ‚Äúown‚Äù the items you‚Äôve claimed have been stolen.


¬†


However, if you no longer have copies of your receipts, your photos of the items uploaded to your account can usually suffice. As a best practice, keep track of your receipts! Have copies emailed to you when you purchase items, or take pictures of receipts and email them to yourself or make a habit of immediately uploading them to your AKKO account.


¬†


You can also try to contact the original seller/retailer you purchased items from as often they will have records going back a year or two of past transactions. You can try providing your name, phone number, email, or credit card number to try and track down a receipt for something you purchased.


¬†


For items you purchased used or through a 3rd party marketplace platform such as Craigslist, eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or OfferUp, request an email be sent to you by a seller stating the date you purchased an item, the amount paid, and what the item was. This can suffice as a purchase receipt! Including if you paid for items in cash.

Can I sign up for an AKKO Plan to cover repairs for phones or electronics that are already damaged?

No. 
Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not how protection plans work. If you have any items that are currently broken (cracked phone screen, water-damaged laptop, etc.), they are not eligible to be added to an AKKO Plan and will not be repaired or replaced by us.
For an item to be eligible for protection, you must:
1. Have an active plan with AKKO

If you do have an item that‚Äôs already damaged in any way, it will need to be repaired fully to be eligible for protection under our plans.

We‚Äôll update your plan and confirm the changes with the insurance company so that your plan can have a higher coverage limit to accommodate your more expensive items, or a higher per incident limit for your stuff.
For Student Plans, we have coverage limits that range from $2,000 to $6,000 per incident in increments of $1,000, all with a $99 deductible.
For Adult Plans, we currently offer plans with per incident coverage limits of $2,000 ‚Äì $6,000 in increments of $1,000, all with a $99 deductible.
If you want to protect multiple phones on a single plan, you may need to upgrade your coverage with an add-on or purchase additional AKKO Plans.

What if I want to sign up for AKKO but my phone is already broken?


NO. Unfortunately that‚Äôs not how protection plans work‚Ä¶ üôÅ


¬†


If you have any items that are currently broken (cracked phone screen, water damaged laptop, etc.) then you CAN NOT sign up and then file a claim to have those items fixed.


¬†


For an item to be eligible for protection, you must:


¬†


1) have an active plan with AKKO


¬†


2) have the item‚Äôs information uploaded to your account along with pictures of it in working and un-damaged condition. This means that you‚Äôve taken photos of the item in accordance with all instructions within your account based on the item you are adding.


¬†


Then, if something happens to any of your items in the future, they‚Äôre protected!


¬†


If you do have an item that‚Äôs currently already damaged, it will need to be repaired fully to be eligible for protection under our plans. If you do have any items currently damaged, get them fixed and then be sure to sign up for either our Phone-only protection plan or our ‚ÄúEverything Protected‚Äù AKKO Plan now so that the next time some mishap happens, we‚Äôll cover it!

How Does Mechanical/Electrical Coverage Work for my Personal Electronics




Our AKKO Plan ( $15/month plan that protects 1 phone + 25 items) includes a mechanical/electrical components failure protection guarantee for all your portable electronic devices and TVs that lasts for 36 months from the date of purchase of each device.


Portable electronic devices and TVs you add to your AKKO account for this protection must have been purchased ‚Äúnew‚Äù by you either within the 120 days prior to your registration, or anytime after you registered your plan. You must upload your purchase receipt with each device you wish to have this protection to your AKKO account.


It‚Äôs basically like having FREE 3-year warranties on all of your portable electronic devices and TVs!


¬†


Terms:


For any of your portable electronic devices or TVs which already have an active warranty which covers mechanical/electrical component failures (either provided by the manufacturer of the device, a retailer/reseller, or third party) any claims pertaining to mechanical/electrical component failures would first go through your existing/included warranty.


¬†


After any existing warranty expires covering mechanical/electrical failures for your eligible devices, AKKO would take over for the remainder of the 36 month period starting from the date of purchase of the eligible portable electronic device or TV.


A portable electronic device is defined as any device which requires either an internal, or external battery to operate. In addition to portable electronics, this protection and these terms also apply to TVs. All claims are still subject to your plan‚Äôs standard service fees/deductibles.


This special protection ends for your devices if you cancel your plan with AKKO and cannot be resumed even if you choose to then re-enroll with AKKO at a later point in time.

¬†


If you have a group of 10+, reach out to [email¬†protected] and we‚Äôd be happy to set you up with an even greater discount.


¬†


We can also generate a special discount code for a group you‚Äôre a part of such as your company, club, school, or other organization like a fraternity or sorority.

How do I cancel my AKKO Plan?


From the ‚Äúsupport‚Äù section in the app, you can choose the link to ‚Äúcancel my plan‚Äù or email us at [email¬†protected]


¬†


Your plan can either continue until the end of your billing cycle, or be terminated immediately and then you will receive an appropriate pro-rated refund of any balance you‚Äôve already paid. If you cancel within the first 30 days from having initially registered, we‚Äôll provide a full refund.
