Genmo, your creative copilot Meet Genmo,your new creative copilotGenmo is the first step towards our approach to Creative General Intelligence where a human and a generative model work together. Today, Genmo can help you create images, videos and 3D models. Collaboration yields more creative and useful results than any AI alone.Sign upDiscordLoading...A Men to a beastgenimageEasyTarponLoading...Cute cat in the forrestgenimageObnoxiousPapayaLoading...Entrando en un agujero negro / conciencia / flor de la vidagenimageBlissfulCherryLoading...zapatilla violetagenimagetomas.httpsLoading...Cute turtle robotgenimagePluckyPixieLoading...A dancing dragon breathing blue firegenimageGentleEgretLoading...A world inside an eyegenimageConcomitantTa...Loading...Queen of the seas, a beautiful woman with a charming face, a young woman, in a blue cloak and a golden crown on her head, full body, close to realitygenimageJoyfulAntelopeLoading...A Lovecraftian MonstergenimageBlushingCatfishLoading...Create a beautiful little girl with a camera in an epic multiverse 8k neon dark room psychedelic futuristic cyberpunk city warrior camera butterflies oil...genimageJoyfulAntelopeLoading...Cute cyberpunk futurist turtlegenimagePluckyPixieLoading...Skeleton kiss dragon flammegenimagePenetratingBa...Loading...Make A painting of megenimageMeekMinotaurLoading...A  black man, with tattoos on his face and black glasses in a Cyberpunk cenario 4kgenimageGratefulFallLoading...a watercolor painting of a hamster godfather king of the world surrounded by mountains of money, wearing sunglasses and smoking in a psychedelic stylegenimageSagradoRemedioLoading...A Men to a beastgenimageEasyTarponLoading...Cute cat in the forrestgenimageObnoxiousPapayaLoading...Entrando en un agujero negro / conciencia / flor de la vidagenimageBlissfulCherryLoading...zapatilla violetagenimagetomas.httpsLoading...Cute turtle robotgenimagePluckyPixieLoading...A dancing dragon breathing blue firegenimageGentleEgretLoading...A world inside an eyegenimageConcomitantTa...Loading...Queen of the seas, a beautiful woman with a charming face, a young woman, in a blue cloak and a golden crown on her head, full body, close to realitygenimageJoyfulAntelopeLoading...A Lovecraftian MonstergenimageBlushingCatfishLoading...Create a beautiful little girl with a camera in an epic multiverse 8k neon dark room psychedelic futuristic cyberpunk city warrior camera butterflies oil...genimageJoyfulAntelopeLoading...Cute cyberpunk futurist turtlegenimagePluckyPixieLoading...Skeleton kiss dragon flammegenimagePenetratingBa...Loading...Make A painting of megenimageMeekMinotaurLoading...A  black man, with tattoos on his face and black glasses in a Cyberpunk cenario 4kgenimageGratefulFallLoading...a watercolor painting of a hamster godfather king of the world surrounded by mountains of money, wearing sunglasses and smoking in a psychedelic stylegenimageSagradoRemedioIntroducing Genmo ChatGenerative models have demonstrated incredible capabilities in synthesizing content across modalities, including text, images, videos, and beyond.With Genmo, we're taking it a step further by providing a creative copilot that works hand-in-hand with users to bring their creative visions to life.We are gradually rolling out alpha access to Genmo Chat to creatives from our waitlist. While there are limitations, we are scaling up capacity and continuously working to improve Genmo's capabilities, safety, and understanding of user intent.Get startedLoading...Your browser does not support the video tag.take away all the other elements and just leave the man in the hooded jacketgenmotionKnowingAppleLoading...Your browser does not support the video tag.70s car driving down a digital landscape, retrowave, synthwave, 8kgenmotionDeviousCornLoading...Your browser does not support the video tag.rippling pool of water, red clouds in the skygenmotionDeviousCornLoading...Your browser does not support the video tag.hooded bearded man holding a planet in his hand, cosmic star dust, galactic, uhd, hdr, 8k, maximalistgenmotionDeviousCornLoading...Your browser does not support the video tag.swirling multicolored neon potion, 8kgenmotionDeviousCornWhat can you create with Genmo Chat?Create 3D assetsGenerate 3D meshes and 360 degree videos with Genmo. Ask for an object like an ice cream sundae, or upload a photo and turn it into 3D.Upload an image and animate part of itGenmo can animate existing images. The user uploads a starry night and asks Genmo to animate the sky into a timelapse. The user controls the animation by asking Genmo to only animate the sky and not the mountain.Generate and edit moviesGenmo can generate and edit movies from scratch. The user asks Genmo to create a movie with a title. The model will help create ideas which the human can critique iteratively. Genmo takes it from there to generate an edited video.Genmo opted to use our V2 video generation model because it can generate coherent global motion. It also automatically selects transitions and text overlays to match the plotline.Write a script, then generate a trailerLike the previous example, Genmo can generate and edit movies from scratch. The user asks to generate a movie called “Godfather: The Lunar Family”.Genmo helps the user refine their ideas into a proposed script. Genmo generates a variety of scenes and transitions. In this example, the user works with Genmo to create a poster photo.Note: These images were created with our V2 image generator. Genmo's current V3 image generator has significantly improved quality.Edit and create photos with wordsReplace content and change image styles with natural language. Genmo allows users to direct the creative process at a high level, while the model suggests specific details and calls the necessary tools to get the job done.Expect even higher image quality today. The demo uses our old Genmo V2 model, and we&'ve since upgraded to a new V3 image generator.Design a presentation with app iconsGenmo can generate app icons as well. Here, Genmo makes icons for a “creative copilot”.In response to user feedback, Genmo regenerates variations of their favorite icon. Finally, Genmo combines all the images into a slide deck to share with the team.Bridging Humans and Generative ModelsTo bridge the gap between humans and generative tools, we're working on improving our models' understanding of user intent and context. This will allow for more seamless collaboration between users and their creative copilot, ultimately leading to better and more useful results.Current CapabilitiesAs a creative assistant, Genmo supports a wide range of tools, such as text-to-image, image editing, image enhancement, video generation, and more. By using natural language, users can instruct Genmo to perform various tasks, including generating new images from descriptions, editing existing images, or even creating looping videos.A Collaborative Future for Creative General IntelligenceWe believe that collaboration is the missing piece from current generative AI models. We are building Genmo to transform the way we as people create content across modalities. Here's what we envision for the future:Empowering creators of all levels: Good ideas can come from anyone, but not everyone has the skills to bring them to life. Genmo Chat can help everyone realize their ideas and create the content that they would like to see.Safe and responsible AI: Our creative copilot will actively steer users away from generating content that may be harmful.Enabling superhuman storytelling: Musicians already use Genmo to create music videos. We envision a future where a creative copilot can help you augment your stories with generations across modalities.Join Us in Building the Future of CreativityWe have ambitious goals for Genmo, and we know that achieving them requires a collective effort. We invite youto join us in exploring the immense potential of generative models. If you're excited about the future we're building and want to be a part of it, please reach out.© Genmo™ 2023 · [email protected]Terms of Service · Privacy PolicyLooking for Genmo V1?The classic experience is still at alpha.genmo.ai →CommunityAboutPricingLog in
