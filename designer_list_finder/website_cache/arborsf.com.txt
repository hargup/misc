“Arbor, the new restaurant by the Absinthe Group in Hayes Valley, has things like a fried chicken sandwich, but it opened with plans to have lots of meat-free items. The vegan burger ($12) comes with two thin, crisp patties made from beans and served with roasted garlic tahini sauce, guacamole and a giant slice of heirloom tomato.”
– Soleil Ho, San Francisco Chronicle









“Now mid-pandemic, The Absinthe Group, which owns Arlequin as well as its namesake restaurant Absinthe and others, has morphed that old cafe space into a new neighborhood spot: Arbor, an iteration on fast-casual Cal-American food, is serving juicy burgers, Tonkin’ salads, and curly fries that seem just right for the takeout age.”
– First Taste: Arbor’s organic double burgers and curly fries are takeout-ready, Sarah Chorey for 7×7 Magazine









“The Absinthe Group has transformed Arlequin Cafe into Arbor, a casual spot with cheeseburgers, fried chicken sandwiches, salads, soft serve, and more. The sleeper hit might be the vegan burger, which is almost like a crispy bean and chickpea falafel with garlic tahini.”
– New on the Resy Hit List, RESY









“The casual menu is full of plant-based options, from vegetable starters and salads to almond-chia seed pudding in the morning—but there’s also a Cobb salad, cheeseburger (featuring Cream Co. grass-fed beef), and a fried chicken sandwich that looks very crispy for meat-eaters.”
– New Openings Include Summer at Saint Joe’s, Nopalito 18th Street, Arbor, Tablehopper









“The Absinthe Group has been part of Hayes Valley for more than 20 years.  We’re happy to introduce our new fast-casual place —Arbor— to the community.”
– Bill Russell-Shapiro, Proprietor, The Absinthe Group
