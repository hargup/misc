            Calisthenics / Street Workout
        


                Calisthenics, also known as Street Workout, is the modern art of bodweight workout in a  public space and outdoor environment. Calisthenics workout combines classic gymnastics exercises like pull ups, push ups, squats and dips, with creativ modern, urban outdoor sports like parkour, breakdance and freerunning. The movements vary from explosive transfer moves between pull up bars to gymnastics peak performances on parallel bars. The one calisthenic exercise, which stands for street workout like no other, is the bar muscle up. It's a high pull up which transfers into a bar dip. For a lot of athletes a neverending love story, since there are so many different ways to perform this particular exercise. Other well known moves are the human flag, front lever, back lever, planche, handstand push ups which often play a big part in various street workout videos on the web.
            

                This kind of sport requires whole body tension, pure strength, dynamics and coordination. As a nice side effect you do not only get stronger while doing calisthenics, but you also gain more visible muscle mass and a better defined body shape.
            

                The origin of this sport is, as is often the case, found in the parks and streets of New York. Athletes have been exercising here since generations in outdoor exercise parks, which are widely spread all over the city. A similar workout culture also exists in Eastern Europe and Russia. The people here call it Ghetto Workout, as well as Street Workout. Many outdoor gyms with high bars can be found in public parks and backyards of large apartment buildings. Internet video platforms, e.g. YouTube, helped to pave the way for this particular fitness trend. In the early 2010s, videos from workout crews like Barstarzz, BarBarians, Bartendaz and Baristi Workout spread rapidly all over the world. Their videos often go viral and it's not unusual for them to reach more than a million views.
