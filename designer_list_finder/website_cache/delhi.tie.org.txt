On ‘The Big Debate’ we pick one current & important topic and bring different, sometimes sharply contrarian, viewpoints and bring them to the table. The debate addresses ‘Elephant in the Room’ topics that founders, investors, and others know are important but are often ignored. Join the program every month and get perspectives from both sides.
