The pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX

                ESLint is an open source project that helps you find and fix problems  with your JavaScript code. It doesn't matter if you're writing JavaScript in  the browser or on the server, with or without a framework, ESLint can help  your code live its best life.

            



Find issues
ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. ESLint is  built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your  continuous integration pipeline.


                        Learn more about finding issues with ESLint





Fix problems automatically
Many problems ESLint finds can be automatically fixed. ESLint fixes are  syntax-aware so you won't experience errors introduced by traditional  find-and-replace algorithms.


                        Learn more about fixing problems automatically with ESLint





Configure everything
Preprocess code, use custom parsers, and write your own rules that work  alongside ESLint's built-in rules. Customize ESLint to work exactly the  way you need it for your project.

testimonials






ESLint has been critical in helping developers write high-quality JavaScript for years. We love that it catches common issues early and often. With a high level of extensibility, ESLint's ability to let teams enforce custom rules that work for them has been excellent for open-source projects and more. Chrome is happy to sponsor ESLint to help web developers write consistently high-quality code. It's an essential piece of the modern web development toolkit.






Addy Osmani
Senior Staff Eng. Manager, Chrome












Nx uses ESLint to enforce code quality, library boundaries, and project visibility constraints. ESLint makes Nx more powerful, so on behalf of the Nx.dev community, we're proud to do our part and sponsor ESLint's continued success!






Jeff Cross
Co-founder and Principal Architect, Nx












ESLint is an extremely useful tool for any JavaScript project. This tool allows us to set up consistent code formatting rules adopted by the whole team from the beginning of the project, greatly facilitates code reviews, and makes it easy to integrate new developers into the team. I know I am not alone in appreciating its flexibility and ease-of-use.

Technical Architect, Salesforce












Most JavaScript projects directly or transitively depend on ESLint. An Indeed employee nominated ESLint to receive a donation from the FOSS Contributor Fund, and their colleagues clearly agreed. We're happy to support the open source technologies that allow us to develop, protect, and maintain the digital infrastructure that supports our products and helps people get jobs.






Duane O'Brien
Head of Open Source, Indeed












ESLint plays a major role in helping us create a safe and consistent experience across a growing number of codebases and engineers. We are grateful for all the open-source projects that are helping us build Contra, and ESLint is the first of many open-source projects that we are committed to back.






Gajus Kuizinas
Co-Founder / CTO, Contra
