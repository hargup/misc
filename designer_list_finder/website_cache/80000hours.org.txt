Research   List of the world's most pressing problemsThe issue you work on is probably the most important factor determining your impact.

We think some such issues even threaten the long-run future of humanity – making them especially high priority. Read problem profiles   List of the most impactful careers we've identified so farThe highest impact paths are those that put you in the best position to tackle the most pressing problems. To help you get ideas for ways to contribute, we review some common options and list some unusual but especially high-impact paths. Read career reviews   Advanced seriesThe series covers our most important and novel research findings about how to increase the impact of your career, including: what “doing good” even means, why reducing existential risk might be humanity’s biggest and most neglected priority, and how to avoid accidentally making things worse.

It’s a group of people devoted to using evidence and reason to figure out the best ways to help others — whether through donations, political advocacy, or their careers. Learn more about the community and how it might be able to help you to have a more impactful career.Our community    Who are we?We started 80,000 Hours when we were about to graduate from Oxford in 2011. Our aim was to provide the advice we wish we’d had back then: transparently explained, based on the best research available, and willing to ask the big questions. By doing this, we hope to get the next generation of leaders tackling the world’s most pressing problems.About usHow come this is all free?We’re an independent nonprofit funded by individual donors and philanthropic foundations. They donate to us so that we can help people have a greater positive impact on the world. We don’t accept any corporate sponsorship or advertising fees.Our donorsWho is this for?Our aim is to help people tackle the world’s biggest and most neglected problems, and our advice is aimed at people who have the good fortune to be able to make that their focus, as well as the security to change paths. Due to our limited capacity, some of our advice focuses on a narrow range of paths, and is especially aimed at talented college students and graduates aged 18–30, though many of the ideas we cover are relevant to everyone.Our audienceWhat research is your advice based on?Our advice is based on hundreds of expert interviews; what we’ve learned advising 4,000+ people one-on-one over 10 years; and where possible, the academic literature on global problems and career success. We’re affiliated with the Global Priorities Institute at the University of Oxford.What is our advice based on?Our impact in numbers:  10m readers    4,000+ advising calls    1,000+ career plan changes recorded   Reader storiesEthan PerezEthan Perez was studying computer science when he came across 80,000 Hours, which convinced him that the risk from advanced artificial intelligence was a highly pressing problem. After speaking with an 80,000 Hours advisor, he decided to work full time on AI safety instead of pursuing a career in self-driving car technology. He went on to write his PhD thesis on fixing undesirable behaviour in language models and took a role as a research scientist working on AI safety at Anthropic. Read moreElika SomaniElika started her career in global health, which she describes as “my first love, career wise”. Over time, 80,000 Hours and the EA community helped her conclude that she could increase her expected impact by pivoting into biosecurity.  She applied for, and was offered, the role of Fellow with the Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health. After speaking with an 80,000 Hours advisor, she decided to accept the job. She now conducts research on neglected problems in biosecurity, and also in clinical research ethics.

After working at a startup in Beijing and in investment banking and learning progressively more about the area, he realised his bilingual background might help position him to aid communication between Chinese and American companies on AI safety. Brian became a researcher at Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, and now runs an independent consulting firm that advises organisations in China and the West on the safety and governance of transformative technologies.
