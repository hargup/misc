(Co-founder) Investment FAQ‣What stages and verticals do you invest in?We invest at the absolute earliest stage - before there is a polished product in market or any meaningful traction (we are ok with an MVP being launched but it is not necessary). Some people might refer to this as pre-seed but we prefer pre-product because we feel it’s more accurate, and it makes it much easier for founders to determine if we are a potential fit for them upfront and vice versa.We are vertical agnostic. We care most about the founding team, their unique insight, and a track record of professional tenacity.‣How do you make investment decisions? Everyone at 43 makes decisions independently based on their conviction in the founder, product and market. We each have a distinct way of developing conviction but all run transparent decision making processes that respect founders’ time.‣Why should I take your money? We are founders building something meaningful ourselves and we operate accordingly. We obsess about delivering the best investor experience and proactively help solve your biggest challenge - getting to product/market fit quickly. Our portfolio is small and concentrated so that we can go deep on context and allow you to maximally leverage our time, knowledge and network.We strive to be your first phone call when things are going well or when they are falling apart. We show up for our founders when needed and without judgment, and we enjoy rolling our sleeves up. Lastly, each of us has a unique skill set we’ve honed by working with dozens of startups over the past decade: raising capital (Dustin), building culture and teams (Anabel), and solving/scaling growth (Soso).‣Where does the name 43 come from? The number 43 is the address of our studio in San Francisco which helped bring us together around a shared vision. Fun fact: 43 is a centered heptagonal number.
