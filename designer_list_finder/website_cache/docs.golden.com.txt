The Golden API enables programmatic access to achieve:

Enrichment: Get structured data on entities over hundreds of fields in Golden Knowledge Base
Discovery: Access query results on millions of entities across Golden Knowledge Base

You'll find comprehensive guides and documentation to help you start working with the Golden API as quickly as possible, as well as support if you get stuck.
Quickstart

First, you will need to get your API key. To find your key, sign in to your Golden account and visit your Golden Workspace settings. 
Look at the Schema reference to see the options for retrieving data. Entity types, such as companies or people, will have a different selection of predicates available.
Understand how rate limiting and data access are accounted for through Limits.
To retrieve information on specific entities, you can use the Entity API. There are example recipes shown for different methods of targeting entity data available on Enrichment.
You can access a query made using boolean filters to select exactly the information you care about using the Query API. Example usage and available filters are available under Discovery.
