            A transportation system can be based on private transportation (meaning roads for cars), or public transportation (meaning trains, subways and bus routes). In general, Sims prefer to drive their cars. If roads are plentiful, more Sims will be willing to live in your city, especially when the city is small. But if you rely exclusively on roads, you'll find that as your population grows, traffic problems become horrendous. Public transit gets cars off the street, and limits air pollution. It's...

Later, as the character accumulates wealth through his adventuring, there are several entries on the screen...

Ancient Egyptian civilization would not have developed as it did had it not been for the Nile's yearly floods. Each year, the Nile would flood, or inundate, its banks. The Egyptians referred to this season as Ahket, and during Ahket farming was impossible. Near the end of Ahket, the Nile receded, leaving behind deposits of rich silt that nourished the soil along the banks. Following Ahket was Proyet, or the growing season. During Proyet, farmers would return to the land and plant crops. Reaping...

Aunt Karen and company are on the brink of capturing an unlikely victory After all, her utter absence of two artistic cells to rub together is overshadowed only by Uncle Randy's atrocious inability to guess under pressure. But for some reason maybe it's something in the Swedish meatballs he and Aunt Karen are actually on the same wavelength And as she draws lines of (supposedly) fur on some (almost) four-legged (I think) creature (let's go with that), your team's...

No one is quite sure how the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids. The process is not depicted in any remaining artifacts. Piecing together evidence from the pyramid sites and depictions of the construction of other types of monuments, most archeologists believe that pyramid construction relied on the use of ramps made from unfired mudbrick and wood. Exactly how the ramps were placed in relation to the pyramid remains a mystery. Some think that the ramps were placed perpendicular to the...

Technology is awesome and so is the human body. Major forces don't always play well together. In Chemistry, one element and another element are harmless alone. But when mixed with each other a reaction may occur. I'm not saying that VR is bad for your eyes because I don't know. I will show you the data and expert opinions relating to this topic. I'm looking to the community to help me out with this question. This still is a valid concern for people.

In Empire Earth the uppermost limit placed on your population is called the population capacity or pop cap. Scenarios each have their own pop cap.

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ROLLING A DIE AND DRAWING A CARD MAYBE MORE THAN YOU REALIZE. In my day job, I design casino games, so I spend a lot of time around cards, dice, and other instruments of randomness. Rolling a die is a classic example of picking with replacement, meaning the pool of possible outcomes remains the same from pick to pick. Drawing a card is a classic example of picking without replacement, meaning the pool of outcomes dwindles with each pick.

When an attack roll is made and it's a 20, your character hits regardless of the target's AC, and you have scored a threat. The hit might be a critical hit or crit . To find out if it's a critical hit, a critical roll is made immediately- this is another attack roll with all the same modifiers as the attack roll that was just made. If the critical roll also results in a hit against the target's AC, the original hit is a critical hit. The critical roll just needs to hit to give a crit. It...

Zones are classified as residential, commercial, and industrial RCI and can be designated as low, medium,...
