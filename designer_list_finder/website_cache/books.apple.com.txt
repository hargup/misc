Apple Books
Read, listen, discover. All in one place.

Apple Books is the single destination for all the books and audiobooks you love — and all the ones you’ll love next. Browse the Book Store and Audiobook Store to find the perfect book to read or listen to. Track what you’ve read and want to read, and set your own Reading Goals — all in one app and across all your Apple devices.







Reading Now. Your digital nightstand.
The Reading Now tab makes it easy to get to the right page in an instant, whether you’re immersed in a single story or bouncing between books. It’s also where you’ll find personalized recommendations based on what you’ve been reading.









Your library, your way.
Organize your library any way you like. With collections, every one of your books is right where you want it. Create your own collections and get to them easily at any time. You can also revisit an old favorite you’ve already read in the Finished collection.









So many books, so much in store.
Swipe from book to book to see which book covers, descriptions, and reviews catch your eye, then add the books you’re interested in to your Want to Read list. Choose from today’s bestsellers, check out lists curated by Apple Books editors, or get recommendations based on what you’ve been listening to or reading.

Listen while you work. Or play. Or drive.
With audiobooks available on CarPlay, Apple Watch, and more, it’s easy to transport yourself to another world during your commute or learn something new on a run.

Search the books you own. Browse millions more.
Now you can find just the book you’re looking for easier and faster than ever. Search through the Book Store and your personal library at the same time. You can return to your recent searches or tap a search suggestion to discover something entirely new.








A Reading Goal you can’t put down.
Setting a Reading Goal helps make reading a priority by tracking the amount of time you’re reading or listening to an audiobook. Build strong reading habits and celebrate your achievements — whether that’s a daily goal, a new streak length record, or how many books you’ve read this year.
