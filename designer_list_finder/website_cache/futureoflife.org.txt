Our missionSteering transformative technology towards benefitting life and away from extreme large-scale risks.We believe that the way powerful technology is developed and used will be the most important factor in determining the prospects for the future of life. This is why we have made it our mission to ensure that technology continues to improve those prospects.Our missionLearn moreOur missionEnsuring that our technology remains beneficial for lifeOur mission is to steer transformative technologies away from extreme, large-scale risks and towards benefiting life. Read moreHow certain technologies are developed and used has far-reaching consequences for all life on earth.If properly managed, these technologies could change the world in a way that makes life substantially better, both for those alive today and those who will one day be born. They could be used to treat and eradicate diseases, strengthen democratic processes, mitigate - or even halt - climate change and restore biodiversity.If irresponsibly managed, they could inflict serious harms on humanity and other animal species. In the most extreme cases, they could bring about the fragmentation or collapse of societies, and even push us to the brink of extinction.The Future of Life Institute works to reduce the likelihood of these worst-case outcomes, and to help ensure that transformative technologies are used to the benefit of life.Our missionCause areasThe risks we focus onWe are currently concerned by three major risks. They all hinge on the development, use and governance of transformative technologies. We focus our efforts on guiding the impacts of these technologies.Artificial IntelligenceFrom recommender algorithms to self-driving cars, AI is changing our lives. As the impact of this technology magnifies, so will its risks.Artificial IntelligenceBiotechnologyFrom the accidental release of engineered pathogens to the backfiring of a gene-editing experiment, the dangers from biotechnology are too great for us to proceed blindly.BiotechnologyNuclear WeaponsAlmost eighty years after their introduction, the risks posed by nuclear weapons are as high as ever - and new research reveals that the impacts are even worse than previously reckoned.Nuclear Weapons

UAV Kargu autonomous drones at the campus of OSTIM Technopark in Ankara, Turkey - June 2020.Our workHow we are addressing these issuesThere are many potential levers of change for steering the development and use of transformative technologies. We target a range of these levers to increase our chances of success. PolicyWe perform policy advocacy in the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations.Our Policy workOutreachWe produce educational materials aimed at informing public discourse, as well as encouraging people to get involved.Our Outreach workGrantmakingWe provide grants to individuals and organisations working on projects that further our mission.Our Grant ProgramsEventsWe convene leaders of the relevant fields to discuss ways of ensuring the safe development and use of powerful technologies.Our EventsFeatured ProjectsWhat we're working onRead about some of our current featured projects:Artificial EscalationOur new fictional film depicts a world where artificial intelligence ('AI') is integrated into nuclear command, control and communications systems ('NC3') with terrifying results.FuturesPromoting Globally Inclusive AI GovernanceOur involvement with the UN's work spans several years and initiatives, including the Roadmap for Digital Cooperation and the Global Digital Compact (GDC).PolicyWorldbuilding CompetitionThe Future of Life Institute accepted entries from teams across the globe, to compete for a prize purse of up to $100,000 by designing visions of a plausible, aspirational future that includes strong artificial intelligence.Futures, OutreachFuture of Life AwardEvery year, the Future of Life Award is given to one or more unsung heroes who have made a significant contribution to preserving the future of life.Futures, OutreachEducating about Lethal Autonomous WeaponsMilitary AI applications are rapidly expanding. We develop educational materials about how certain narrow classes of AI-powered weapons can harm national security and destabilize civilization, notably weapons where kill decisions are fully delegated to algorithms.Outreach, PolicyStrengthening the European AI ActOur key recommendations include broadening the Act’s scope to regulate general purpose systems and extending the definition of prohibited manipulation to include any type of manipulatory technique, and manipulation that causes societal harm.PolicyMitigating the Risks of AI Integration in Nuclear LaunchAvoiding nuclear war is in the national security interest of all nations. We pursue a range of initiatives to reduce this risk. Our current focus is on mitigating the emerging risk of AI integration into nuclear command, control and communication.PolicyFuture of Life Institute PodcastA podcast dedicated to hosting conversations with some of the world's leading thinkers and doers in the field of emerging technology and risk reduction. 140+ episodes since 2015, 4.8/5 stars on Apple Podcasts.Outreach
