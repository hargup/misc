From today's featured article




Lisa Nowak (born 1963) is a former NASA astronaut and United States Navy officer. Nowak graduated from the Naval Academy in 1985. A naval aviator, she was selected for NASA Astronaut Group 16 in 1996, qualifying as a mission specialist in robotics. She flew in space in July 2006 aboard Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-121 mission, where she was responsible for operating the robotic arms of the shuttle and the International Space Station. In February 2007, Nowak was arrested in Orlando, Florida, after she drove about 900 miles (1,400 km) from Texas and accosted and pepper-sprayed Colleen Shipman, a U.S. Air Force captain. Shipman's boyfriend, astronaut William Oefelein, had been in a relationship with Nowak. Terminated by NASA, Nowak pled guilty to burglary and battery in 2009, after which the Navy demoted and discharged her under other than honorable conditions. It was later reported that Nowak was working in Texas. (Full article...)

Today's featured picture














The Crucifixion and Last Judgement Diptych consists of two small painted panels attributed to the Early Netherlandish artist Jan van Eyck, with areas finished by unidentified followers or members of his workshop. The diptych is one of the early Northern Renaissance oil-on-panel masterpieces, renowned for its unusually complex and highly detailed iconography, and for the technical skill evident in its completion. It was executed in a miniature format; the panels are just 56.5 cm (22.2 in) high by 19.7 cm (7.8 in) wide. The diptych was probably commissioned for private devotion. The left wing depicts the Crucifixion, while the right wing portrays scenes associated with the Last Judgement: a hellscape at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of Christ in Majesty flanked by a Great Deësis. The diptych is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, United States.

Painting credit: Jan van Eyck (attributed)
