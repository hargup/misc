About Us
Born out of one man's need to sell a business, BusinessesForSale.com started in the mid-1990s as an online bulletin board. 
Since those early days our passion for introducing people who want to buy a business to those who are selling a business has grown exponentially along with the site. BusinessesForSale.com has evolved into a truly global service that connects over a million business buyers and sellers each and every month.
For 20 years we have been helping business brokers and private sellers market their listings. From cafes to construction businesses, some of our most exciting business opportunities have included the makers of Big Ben's clock, a Chinese toll road, a crocodile farm in Thailand and even a tropical island!
We have become the world's largest marketplace advertising 57,879 businesses for sale in over 130 countries. The website is proudly run by our team of 32 based in London, Sydney, North Carolina and Mexico City.
We're always looking to improve the site and our service so if you have any feedback or you are looking to sell your business, we'd love to hear from you. Contact Us.
