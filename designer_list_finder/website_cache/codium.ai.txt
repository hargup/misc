Generating meaningful tests for busy devs

With CodiumAI, you get non-trivial tests (and trivial, too!) suggested right inside your IDE, so you can code smart, create more value, and stay confident when you push.Code, as you meant it.

Write code that works the way you meant it to
By analyzing your code, docstring, and comments, and by interacting with you,  TestGPT suggests tests as you code. All you have to do is accept and commit them.

    if (check_valid_input(coefficients, vector) == False):

    rows, columns = np.shape(coefficients)

    # augmented matrix
    augmented_mat = create_augmented_matrix(coefficients, vector)

    # scale the matrix leaving it triangular
    augmented_mat = scale_matrix(augmented_mat, rows)

    x = retroactive_resolution_full_augmented_mat(augmented_mat, columns)

Generate test




































Code smart
Get full visibility of how your code behaves and how the changes you make affect the rest of your code.



Create value
Spend fewer hours writing questionable test cases and more time developing useful features for your users.



Stay confident
Unlike code coverage quotas, meaningful tests actually check your code‚Äôs functionality. So you get the confidence needed to commit.







Generates meaningful tests that help you understand how your code behaves
 Generate meaningful tests, find edge cases and suspicious behaviors, and be empowered to write reliable code.

What a great tool !!! I improved my development time by 2x at least.
It‚Äôs incredible to write docs and tests, two very boring tasks. And almost plug and play, not many configurations üôÇ
However, I couldn‚Äôt set up to run the tests on my pipenv environment (maybe It has been my fault)

Even though I have limited experience writing tests, I know that it is an essential, although slightly tedious, task. CodiumAI changes this and makes testing fun! I like that it caters to many frameworks, e.g., Vitest, Mocha, Jasmine, and more. The code suggestions are the cherry on top, though, I love it!

The future is here. This gives more in-depth code reviews than many humans. It also comes up with test cases I would not have thought of and catches edge case bugs.

Just started to use CodiumAI, and fell in love. The test option, suggestions, and detail about the code, etc are very good.
Testing a function and codes may need to adjust some parameters to get the desired result, but yes it is still a lot more to go.
Kudos to all the teams for this fantastic add-on.

As a developer who spends countless hours coding, I‚Äôm always looking for tools that can enhance my productivity and workflow.
Codium AI is a game-changer for me. Even though it‚Äôs not perfect, it boosts productivity a lot!

One of the best extensions, it makes life easier by generating unit tests automatically, Integrates smoothly with VSCode, and assists in enhancing the quality of your code. Amazingly good !!

Once in a while, you encounter a tool that radically improves your productivity.
CodiumAI may just have joined the ranks of tools like Storybook and Gherkin for me in reducing my work-load while improving its output quality.
Amazing extension!

‚ÄúThis is a literal game changer.
Any newer dev that starts using this is going to be so far ahead of their competition‚Äù



Jack Forge
Founder @FiveSurge


‚ÄúOptimistic and inspired. Just tried the @CodiumAI tool today, and I think it is the first true 10x dev tool. I find it far more utilitarian than co-pilot.‚Äù



Travis
Full Stack Web Developer @Travis_codez


‚ÄúI think a big portion of my shock was that I thought the tests were going to be just some random templates that didn‚Äôt do much. I didn‚Äôt think it would generate so many and they actually be detailed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have already used @CodiumAI and would be glad to recommend it to the community to give a try ‚úîÔ∏è‚Äù

Review from ¬†
The software development I knew is now gone forever.Last week, I started testing @CodiumAI's Visual Studio Code plugin to propose and generate unit tests for my code. I'm never going back.I'm now 10x faster, and my code is much better.

Review from ¬†
This is the best superpower AI tool for Developers. This tool can enables busy devs to create meaningful tests for Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript code.

CodiumAI isn't perfect
You should always double-check the tests CodiumAI generates


AI and ML have come a long way, but they're far from perfect. So while CodiumAI helps you break fewer things and be more productive, it needs your help to do so. That's why we designed it to be interactive ‚Äì so you can edit the tests it generates and perfect them.

Found a bug?

LET US KNOW










I have a few questions‚Ä¶




Why don‚Äôt I just ask ChatGPT/Copilot to write my tests? How is CodiumAI different? 




Unlike general-purpose code completion or generation tools, CodiumAI is focuses on code integrity: generating tests that help you understand how your code behaves, finding edge cases and suspicious behaviors, and making your code more robust. CodiumAI is not another fancy ‚ÄòLanguage-model-API in your IDE‚Äô, because - a. We‚Äôre pro at testing-domain prompting b. We parallelize and chain multiple prompts to create a unique variety of meaningful tests c. We efficiently gather broad code context for the prompts d. We let you interact on each test separately.




When will I be able to start using CodiumAI? Is it free?




You already can! Just download our free VSCode extension and/or JetBrains plugin and get meaningful tests. CodiumAI is free for individual developers, and we even plan to publish an open-source. In the future, we'll launch a paid plan for enterprises.



What languages are supported?




We support practically every programming language. However, some features (such as unit-test generation) are only supported by Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java. We support these in VSCode & JetBrains IDEs.




How does CodiumAI make sure my code stays secure?




We take security, privacy, and compliance very seriously. CodiumAI only analyzes the code necessary to give it enough context to generate meaningful tests, and the data is SSL encrypted. Also, we are SOC2 certified. To learn more, please visit our Trust Center.



Does CodiumAI write perfect tests?




AI and ML have come a long way, but nothing's perfect. While CodiumAI can boost your productivity and improve code integrity, please always double-check the tests it generates. We are here to give you superpowers, but you still need to think and use them wisely.



I want to join you guys!




We‚Äôd love to have that conversation. Feel free to email us at [email¬†protected], please attach your resume.
