Frontier AirlinesFrontier Airlines is another ultra- low- cost airline in the United States. It is the company’s commitment to deliver “Low Fares Done Right”, this is more than a tagline to them, and they said it is their driving philosophy. They believe travel should be for everyone. Low fares allow people to travel more often, see new places, connect with family and loved ones and develop business opportunities. The airlines believed that they are working harder than anyone in the airline industry to help you save money on your flights, but we know that low fares alone aren’t enough. This is through their commitment to their customers ‘Done Right’ promise. This means providing you with a real choice – with options that allow you to customize your flight to match both your wants and your wallet. And we are committed to providing safe, on-time and reliable service while at the same time treating you with Rocky Mountain hospitality like only the airlines staff can provide.The COVID 19 pandemic did not spare Frontier Airlines. In 2020, class-action lawsuits against Frontier were filed after the company refused to refund airfare for customers who could not travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company accepted part of the $25 billion in U.S. government funds to offset financial damage to the airline industry during the COVID 19 outbreak. In 2021, Frontier filed for an Initial Public Offering (IPO).Frontier Airlines DestinationsFrontier Airlines operates an extensive destinations network within the U.S., flying between some of the most popular airports in the country.  Frontier operates flights to over 100 destinations throughout the United States and 31 international destinations which include El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Canada.The airline has announced 18 new routes for summer 2020. The new flights will begin in June and will expand the airline’s rapidly growing presence in major US cities, including Boston, Chicago, Newark and Philadelphia.  And in April 2021, it announces its expansion of summer 2021 service with eight new nonstop routes in key markets, including Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, plus the addition of Alaska to the airline’s network.  At Frontier, we’re all about making it possible for more people to fly more often with affordable fares and convenient service. But of course it’s the airlines concern the health and safety of customers and team members is Frontier’s number one priority. With that in mind, Frontier introduced sweeping health and safety enhancements in 2020 that touch every step of a customer’s travel journey with the airline.Frontier requires all customers and crew members wear a face covering throughout their travel journey. Plus, anyone flying with Frontier must complete a health acknowledgement prior to flying confirming that: Neither they nor anyone in their household has exhibited Covid-19 related symptoms in the last 14 daysThey will wash their hands/sanitize before boarding the flightThey understand and acknowledge the airline’s face covering policy and pre-boarding temperature screening policiesThough the airline is ultra-low-cost carrier, the priority is still the safety and health of its passengers. BaggageGeneral Carry-on InformationCarry-on bags can be no larger than 24"H, 16"W, 10"D which including handles, wheels, and straps and no heavier than 35 pounds.
