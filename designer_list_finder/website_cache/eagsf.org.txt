The Adventure Begins













help id our legacy businesses



EAG is preparing its 2020 list of Legacy Business candidates and YOU can help!Great neighborhood are made up of its people and its businesses. In the midst of many changes in the City, we need to support our many businesses that have been here for decades through thick and thin.While we were looking forward to meeting all of you at Excelsior Heritage Night, like you we are instead sheltering in place to ensure that our communities remain safe and healthy. This hasn't stopped us from continuing our Excelsior District month online as part of our new Heritage in the Neighborhoods program, and we'd like to share what SF Heritage has written so you may easily find what you missed.  Join us when this exciting new project is again scheduled at the Italian American Social Club (25 Russia Ave.) where we will welcome you to a community open house with our partner SF Heritage Foundation.​To learn more about the Legacy Business Program and the benefits both to building owners and businesses listed on the Legacy Business Registry, click the Legacy Business Button below
