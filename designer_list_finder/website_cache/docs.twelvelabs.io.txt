The Twelve Labs advantages
The table below provides a basic comparison between Twelve Labs Video Understanding platform and other cloud-based solutions:


Simplified API integration: The platform allows you to perform a rich set of video understanding tasks with just a few API calls, enabling you to concentrate on building your application rather than aggregating data from separate image and speech APIs or managing multiple data sources.
Natural language querying: With Twelve Labs, you can compose simple or complex queries using everyday language to pinpoint the precise moments you're looking for within your videos. You can also define new categories to classify video content rather than relying on a limited set of pre-generated tags that are not relevant to your use cases.
Fine-tuning capabilities: While our state-of-the-art foundation model for video understanding already provides highly accurate results, we can provide fine-tuning capabilities to help you get more out of the models and achieve better results with only a few examples. For details on fine-tuning the models, please reach out to us at sales[at]twelvelabs.io.
