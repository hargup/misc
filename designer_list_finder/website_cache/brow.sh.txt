Browsh is a fully-modern text-based browser. It renders
          anything that a modern browser can; HTML5, CSS3, JS, video and even WebGL.
          Its main purpose is to be run on a remote server and accessed via SSH/Mosh
          or the in-browser HTML service in order to significantly reduce bandwidth and thus both
          increase browsing speeds and decrease bandwidth costs.
        










Download (v1.8.0)
          Browsh is available as a single static binary on all major platforms.
          The only dependency is a recent 57+ version of Firefox.

Live SSH Demo
Temporarily offline

            Just point your SSH client to brow.sh, eg;
            ssh brow.sh. No auth needed. The service
            is for demonstration only, sessions last 5 minutes and are logged.

              Note that SSH is actually a very inefficient protocol, for best results install
              Browsh on your own server along with Mosh.
            



In-browser Services
Temporarily offline



html.brow.sh
                Uses very basic graphics and HTML anchor tags.
                Although this service may appear similar to the terminal client it does not yet have feature parity.


text.brow.sh Uses nothing but pure text,
                better for usage with curl, for instance.
