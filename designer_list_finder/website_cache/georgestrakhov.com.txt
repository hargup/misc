George Strakhov's Creative Midwifery






















George Strakhov'sCheerful Insanity

    Hello, I'm George. I like to play with sounds, words, and books (1, 2, 3). Professionally speaking, I earn my living helping people give birth to ideas. 
    

    I doodle and read a lot and am also into collecting curious stories and interesting questions about the AI future.
    

    Key parts of my cultural DNA are here.
    

    Lately I've been thinking about hybrid systems for creative problem solving, as well as about new musical instruments and the benefits of Elvish technology.
    

    Gosh, that was a lot of "I"s, so please send me an email and introduce yourself as well. I'm curious to find out who you are and what brought you to my little corner of the Internet.
    

      May the Force be with you,
      
      +G
