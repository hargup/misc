Lead magnets are the difference between high conversion rates and wasted traffic.





Low Conversion Rate
In this example there is no compelling reason for a website visitor to enter their email address. As a result, most people will ignore this popup form.



High Conversion Rate
In this example the playbook is a lead magnet, it acts as an incentive to encourage casual visitors to share their email address.

Lead Capture
Does your website not generate as many leads as you would like?
Believe it or not but more traffic is not the answer to your problems.
Spending resources on more traffic before optimising your website for conversions is like pouring water into a leaky bucket.
Every person who visits your website and reads your content is a potential lead. You just need to give them a good reason to share their email address.

Resource Library
Collect documents, videos, links and audio files in one place so your audience can quickly find what they need.
Most businesses have dozens of files scattered across hard drives, Dropbox, Google Suite and whatever video hosting platform you’re using these days.
These resources are valuable business assets and if your customers can’t easily access them then they may as well not exist.
Beacon helps you to organise these files in one central location so your customers can find what they need and you can generate more leads.
