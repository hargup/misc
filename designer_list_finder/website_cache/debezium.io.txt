Debezium lets your apps react every time your data changes, and you don't have to change your apps that modify the data. Debezium continuously monitors your databases and lets any of your applications stream every row-level change in the same order they were committed to the database. Use the event streams to purge a cache, update search indexes, generate derived views and data, keep other data sources in sync, and much more. In fact, pull that functionality out of your app and into separate services.         Simplify your apps  Since Debezium can monitor your data, why have one app update the database and update search indexes and send notifications and publish messages? Doing that correctly - especially when things go wrong - is really tough, and if you get it wrong the data in those system may become inconsistent. Keep things simple, and move that extra functionality into separate services that use Debezium.                   Never miss a beat  Take your apps and services down for maintenance, and Debezium keeps monitoring so that when your apps come back up they'll continue exactly where they left off. No matter what, Debezium keeps the events in the same order they were made to the database. And Debezium makes sure that you always see every event, even when things go wrong.         React quickly  When all things are running smoothly, Debezium is fast. And that means your apps and services can react quickly. Debezium is built on top of Apache Kafka, which is proven, scalable, and handles very large volumes of data very quickly.
