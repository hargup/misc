Assign custom priorities to SAST issues, create ignore rules, and enable developers to take action proactively.Educate developers to prevent obvious security mistakesSecurity is everyoneâs job, but not everyone deeply understands security. Enforcing secrets scanning and mandating security checks enables your team to write secure code.DeepSource helped us adding security checks without making our CI more complex. It caught several security issues that could have been potentially very, very catastrophic.Ramiro Berrelleza -Founder & CEO, OktetoUnderstand your code health from one single dashboardWith in-depth reporting of key metrics, uncover code health trends, identify areas that need the teamâs attention, and track progress every week.Build trust with shareable security reportsEnforce compliance with industry-standard security recommendations like OWASPÂ® Top 10 and SANS/CWE Top 25 and share these reports with stakeholders in a couple of clicks.Reduce onboarding time for new developersSystemize your teamâs coding conventions with rules and quality gates across all repositories, so itâs easier for new developers to start contributing.Increase velocity of shipping softwareCode review automation has been proven to decrease average pull-request merge time by at least 30%. Enable your team to move fast while shipping clean and secure code.DeepSource complements our CI and has help us adopt source code quality as critical part of a larger DevOps strategy. It has been a pleasure to use this product.Lewis McGibbney -Senior Engineer, NASA Jet Propulsion LaboratoryLoved by developers.

The team has been very responsive working with us, forging a strong working partnership with our product security team.Yash KosarajuDirector of Infrastructure SecurityI'm a big fan of DeepSource. I reviewed quite a few products to better support our engineers and the quality of problems found was far better than Codacy or Code Climate for our Python backend codebase.Adam PietrzyckiEngineeringWe compared it against other tools and DeepSource seemed to find more meaningful things in the code. Since we've adopted it, we've hired more junior-level engineers to focus on the bug risks and security issues DeepSource finds. It finds things our engineers generally miss.John CraftVP of EngineeringDeepSource looks at things that might create a security problem or a performance problem going forward; or if we're violating a best practice. All that gets codified into DeepSource and as developers, for code reviews, now we can focus on higher-order bits.Arpit MohanCo-founder & CEODeepSource is static code analysis for humans. Stop wasting your time setting up and maintaining CLI tools on CI, just use DeepSource.Ruslan KuprieievTeam LeadThanks to DeepSource, all our code quality practices are now automated. It automatically highlights code quality issues and helps us fix them even before someone reviews the code manually â saving a lot of the reviewer's time.Joy Lal ChattarajEngineeringTry DeepSource todayStart managing your codehealth from a single platform.
