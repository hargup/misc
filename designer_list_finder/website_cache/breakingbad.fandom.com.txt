Did You Kno105w?

...that Peter Gould asserted that Better Call Saul would time jump to settings before, during, and after Breaking Bad to show different eras of Saul's life?
... that despite the cold opens showing Mike Ehrmantraut and the Los Pollos Hermanos employees breathing cold air in the back of the delivery truck, it was actually pretty temperate?
...that Hector Salamanca was originally meant to be the main villain in seasons three and four, not Gustavo Fring?
...that Vince Gilligan admitted in an interview that Luis Moncada and Daniel Moncada went totally above and beyond anything he could imagine about what the characters of the Cousins would be?
