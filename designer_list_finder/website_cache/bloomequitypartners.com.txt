We are a team of experienced investors and operators who deliver superior returns to our investment partners and management teams.About UsBloom Equity Partners is leveraging decades of investing and operating experience to rapidly unlock transformational growth and deliver superior returns to our investment partners and management teams.  Investing exclusively in lower-middle market technology, software and tech-enabled business service companies, Bloom drives enduring market value by partnering closely with founders and management teams, injecting capital to unlock growth and providing operational resources and expertise to enable meaningful step-change to the business. 
 
Pairing flexible capital with proprietary operating playbooks, we strive for Bloom to be the investor of choice for ambitious management teams seeking to accelerate their growth and market leadership.
​
We believe there’s no higher quality business model than high margin, recurring and re-occurring revenue businesses providing mission critical products and services with a competitive moat, a sticky and diversified customer base and strong management teams who are destined for greatness but need additional capital, expertise, and partnership to thrive. We look for opportunities to accelerate top line growth both organically, through operational best practices, and inorganically, through accretive M&A.
 
Whether the business is bootstrapped, a division of a larger private organization, publicly traded or operating with a modest amount of previous capital investment, Bloom has the capability and experience to invest and unlock value.  Investment CriteriaTarget Company AttributesIndustryB2B Technology, Software and Technology-enabled Business ServicesGrowth5%+ annual revenue growthGeographyNorth America, Western Europe or Australia/New ZealandRetention80%+ gross annual customer retentionRevenue$5m to $50m+ in ARRProfitabilityPositive EBITDA or near breakeven within 12 monthsServicesTransaction Focus•  Majority investments & growth-oriented buyouts•  Operational control required•  Management-led buyouts•  Add-on acquisitions•  Carve-outs & divestitures•  Take-PrivatesSign Up to the Bi-Weekly Bloom Newsletter: Software PE insights delivered to over 6,000 investors & operators.HomeAboutInvestment CriteriaTeamPortfolioNews & InsightsContactLinkedInFinder's ProgramCareers© 2023 by Bloom Equity Partners Management, LLC.Privacy PolicyDisclaimer, Terms and Conditionsbottom of page
