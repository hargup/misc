Helping businesses build software for hard problems.
We are a boutique software consulting company. We have built and scaled complex web-apps, visualizations and high-throughput messaging systems.




More challenging the work, more interested we are.
We have worked on energy management software, payment gateway,
  e-commerce front-end, software measuring carbon footprint,
  HR management software, video encoding pipeline and
  more.

For client projects, we have used
     React,
     Webpack,
     Ruby,
     node.js,
     AngularJS,
     TypeScript,
     D3.js, Elixir,
  GStreamer. For our own projects, we have played with
   Golang,
   Erlang,
   Haskell,
   Python and more.




Our Ethos
As a company, we are trying to build a place for individuals. We care about each one of us having their own explorations, growing in skills and perspectives. We list some of these explorations in the hacks page.
