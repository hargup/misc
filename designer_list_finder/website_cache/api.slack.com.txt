Hello World Announcement Bot Welcome Bot GitHub Issue Create a custom function for Workflow Builder Define App Request Time Off Your appsSign in to Slack to manage appsUnlock your productivity potential with Slack PlatformConnect, simplify, and automate work.Get StartedExplore samplesSave time with Slack's new modular automation toolsWith our new modular foundation, automation is grounded in building blocks. They're remixable, reusable, and hook into everything flowing in and out of Slack.
FunctionsCreate modular functions that automate work in Slack and connect with your services.
Share your functions so anyone can add them to their own workflows.
WorkflowsWorkflows let you create complex and adaptable automations by building chains of functions.
Use your custom functions, pick from pre-defined Slack functions, or combine both to get the workflows you want.
TriggersAdd triggers to customize how and when to kick off a workflow.
React to events in Slack, run on a schedule, or trigger from external services using webhooks.
Deploy ideas fasterOur developer tools simplify the most tedious parts of development and ensure your automations are enterprise-grade from day one.
Slack CLIFast track development by creating, scaffolding, and deploying functions and apps from the command line.
Managed infrastructureDeploy your automations to secure and managed Slack infrastructure, so you can focus on building.
DatastoresStreamline all your standard database operations by storing, querying and deleting data on Slack infrastructure.
App manifestsSave time when creating and configuring apps by using shareable and reusable manifest files.
LoggingResolve issues faster by using function-level and app-level logging to debug.
Your work just works, on any deviceBlock Kit lets you build interfaces without a UI designer. It's available for use in surfaces across all devices without any extra code.
