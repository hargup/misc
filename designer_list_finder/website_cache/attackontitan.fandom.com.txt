Synopsis


"That day, the human race remembered the terror of being dominated by them, and the shame of being held captive in a birdcage..." — Over 100 years ago, a natural predator of humanity appeared: the Titans, giant humanoid but mindless monsters whose sole purpose of existence seemed to be to devour humans. There was an insurmountable gap in power between them and mankind, and as a result, humanity was rapidly exterminated to the brink of extinction. The survivors responded by constructing three concentric walls: Wall Maria, Wall Rose and Wall Sina, which graced them with a century of peace. However, one day a Colossal Titan far larger than any other seen before breached the outer wall, allowing the smaller Titans to invade the human territory and forcing the survivors to retreat to the inner walls. Eren Jaeger, a boy whose mother was eaten during the invasion, vowed to wipe every last Titan off the face of the Earth, and joined the military determined to exact his revenge.

Anime Manga  Episode #88(March 4th, 2023)
Hange Zoë (ハンジ・ゾエ Hanji Zoe?, also translated as Hans Zoe) was the 14th and current Commander (団長 Danchō?) of the Scout Regiment, formerly a section commander (分隊長 Bun-taichō?) in charge of the Fourth Squad, until the death of the 13th Commander - Erwin Smith - who named Hange as his successor shortly before. Hange conducted research on Titans to the point of being obsessed with them. As a result, they were deeply interested in Eren Jaeger and his ability to transform into a Titan.


Hange is among the many surprised recruits present when Levi, Isabel Magnolia, and Furlan Church are introduced to the Scout Regiment as new recruits. Along with Moblit, Hange enthusiastically watches Levi demonstrate his omni-directional mobility gear skills during training, commenting on how individual skill and style weigh in on performance and outcomes in battle. Hange is impatiently waiting to leave Trost District for the 49th expedition outside the Walls, wanting to capture a Titan to study. Hange tries to convince Levi and Miche Zacharius to help them capture one but they both dismiss them. After the expedition has begun, Hange attempts to convince the commander, Erwin Smith, to authorize a Titan capture operation, but he refuses. They then take their frustration out on Oruo Bozad, telling him how important it is to study targets if they are going to win while choking him.

Eren Yeager (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the Survey Corps. He was the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District with his parents until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan.


After Eren is woken from a nightmare by Mikasa, the two walk home through Shiganshina. They are harassed by Hannes, who begins teasing Eren for having apparently cried in his sleep. Eren is annoyed to see that Hannes and his friends are slacking off on the job and refuses to be placated by their claims that the Titans will never breach Wall Maria.[1] Leaving Hannes behind, the children stop again to watch the Survey Corps return from an expedition and Eren is crestfallen to see that the Corps has returned defeated.Upon returning home, Mikasa reveals to Eren's mother that he wants to join the Survey Corps. Carla forbids him from joining due to the Corps' high mortality rate and begs Grisha to talk some sense into his son. Grisha ignores her objections and instead announces that he will be leaving for a few days on a trip, promising Eren that when he gets back he will show the boy what he has hidden in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to join the Survey Corps, and they exchange a heated argument before he runs off.

Latest Release


AnimeManga 
THE FINAL CHAPTERS Special 1 (完結編（前編） Kanketsu-hen (Zenpen)?) is the 88th episode of the Attack on Titan anime. It was produced by MAPPA.


The march of Eren Jaeger and the Wall Titans reaches the Marleyan city of Liberio, killing most of its people, though some survivors escape. Eren has known since he first arrived in Marley that he would one day flatten this city, and feels trapped by a future he cannot change because to behave differently would not be in his nature. Despite this, he calls his friends into the Paths in order to tell them that there can be no compromise so long as their stances are unwavering. The only thing left is for them to fight.
The combined group of surviving Scouts and Warriors manage to get the flying boat fueled and prepared at Odiha, but not without a costly delay caused by Floch Forster. Hange Zoë fights the approaching Titans alone to buy the group time, handing command over to Armin Arlelt. The group catches up with Eren near Fort Salta, one of the last bastions of humanity in Marley. Following a failed bombing run by the Marleyan military, the Scouts and Warriors jump from the flying boat and on to the back of Eren's Founding Titan.

Read the full summary here. 
Toward the Tree on That Hill (あの丘の木に向かって Ano Oka no ki ni Mukatte?) is the 139th chapter of the Attack on Titan manga, written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama.


After Eren Yeager's death at the hands of Mikasa Ackerman, many of his former comrades from Paradis Island begin recalling memories of him visiting them that were erased due to the power of the Founding Titan. Armin Arlert recalls how they discussed Eren being responsible for killing a vast majority of humanity during the Rumbling and reveals his true feelings about Mikasa, wishing to be able to live with her and the others in peace.
In the present, Armin notices his Titan form dissolving into steam and spots Mikasa approaching with Eren's head. He mourns his best friend's death and while Mikasa leaves to bury his remains, Armin approaches the Marleyan troops with the other Eldians and claims responsibility for the death of Eren. Several years pass and peace talks have begun between those living in Marley and the island of Paradis, which has begun mobilizing an army for the time when Marley and the other countries seek their revenge. As Mikasa sits beneath the tree where Eren is buried, she thinks about him and notices a bird flying to her. The bird picks at her scarf and adjusts it before flying away.
As the years go by, Mikasa raises a new family before passing away. Afterwards, Paradis is destroyed by war, and many countless years later Eren's colossal tree is rediscovered by a wandering child.
