About





Hi, I'm Eugene Yan, 

I design, build, and operate machine learning systems that serve customers at scale.
Currently, I'm a Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon.
Outside of work, I also...


Write, speak, and prototype on ideas in machine learning, RecSys, and LLMs.
Curate papers, guides, and interviews on applying machine learning effectively.
Host monthly ML meetups with practitioners and a weekly LLM reading group.
Send a newsletter on data, ML, and what I'm learning to 5,700+ subscribers.

Eugene Yan is a time-travelling philosopher. He is fluent in communicating with people via writing and speaking, and
machines via coding, and uses his abilities to make the world a better place. Currently, he works at a bookstore and
builds machine learning systems to help people read more while looking for his next epic quest that will make his
previous work appear like a footnote in his life.
