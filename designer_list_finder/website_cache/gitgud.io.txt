FAQ and Information

Terms of Service

TL;DR: No content considered illegal in the US, no spam or bot posting, no abuse of GitGud infrastructure, storage, or CI/compute for non-development purposes

Background and History
GitGud.io was created October 2014 in response to other popular git hosting services active participation in user politics. Sapphire runs GitGud.io along with many other services. We are a user-supported open source company. Our company is designed in such a way that users are our only source of income, so we only serve them, their needs, and no other 3rd parties. This allows us to keep high standards of privacy and customer service.

How do you make money with GitGud being free?
We don't! We used to rely entirely on donations, but these days, we pay for GitGud out-of-pocket from our normal jobs. We have learned a lot about hosting stuff inexpensively. We own our hardware out-right so we don't have the same recurring monthly costs.
We aim to make money through premium sold services via Sapphire. We will never take away what was free, and GitGud started a decade ago free and will stay free

Is there a limit to how big my repo can be?
Nope, we have no limit on how big a repo can be or how many you can have. We just ask that repos contain data related to development and that binary data be stored in Git LFS

Cloudflare Access Deny on Sign In/Sign Up
If you are getting an Access Denied page from Cloudflare on Sapphire Accounts, it is because your country's IP is blacklisted due to high volumes of abuse. If your country ends up on this blacklist, we will not remove it for your individual use. Utilize a VPN on a US based or western Europe based hosting service using non-Digital Ocean IPs.
