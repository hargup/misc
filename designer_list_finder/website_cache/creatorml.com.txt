                        CreatorML uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate titles similar to the ones you've input.
                        
                            Before returning title suggestions, CreatorML tries to filter them based on their risk of containing
                            offensive
                            content, and as a result may return fewer titles than requested.
                        

However, you will only be charged credits
                                for
                            the titles that are returned, and not for the ones that are dropped.

We love using CreatorML to learn what stands out and what we simply miss with our own eyes.
        This
        way we can
        make sure our audience will have the best experience when seeing our videos.

Using the YouTube Click-Through Rate Predictor has helped me optimise my thumbnails to not
        only stand out more, but be something that people actually want to click on. CTR is one of
        the most important metrics on YouTube, so to be able to have a tool out there that helps me decide and one
        that really does work is now crucial for my videos. Highly recommend!

CreatorML has been a fantastic tool for YouTube and our strategy moving forward. It has taken
        a
        lot of the
        guesswork out and has helped increase our overall CTR. There really is no other tool that has had such a
        positive impact on our channels.
