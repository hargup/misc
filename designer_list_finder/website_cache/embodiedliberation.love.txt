Embodied Liberation




aboutOfferingsconnectreflectionsblog“Love life. Engage in it. Give it all you’ve got. Love it with a passion because life truly does give back, many times over, what you put into it.” 
— Maya Angelou
 
Breann's deepest devotion lies in the discovery and exploration into all the ways of living embodied in liberation, authenticity, love, and pleasure . Offeringsmentoringsomatic sexological body workretreatsworkshopsjourney workReflectionsBreann’s gentle guidance and support during  times of emotional inner turmoil have helped me to see my truth and finally choose myself. She asks thoughtful questions that allow me to be my own guide while feeling completely accepted no matter what path I take or how I show up. I am grateful to have her as loving mirror for what I can’t see in myself.
