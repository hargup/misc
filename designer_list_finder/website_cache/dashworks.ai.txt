When an app is disconnected, our system automatically purges the data.â All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.â We typically only access customer data only for troubleshooting purposes, and follow SOC-2-enforced best practices by logging all internal access to customer data.â We donât share customer data with 3rd parties.â We donât use customer data to train language models that may be shared between customers. We only use it to personalize and improve the quality of responses for each individual customer.â If youâre uncomfortable with Dashworks indexing your data, we recommend using our Dash AI chatbot.
