As a healthcare marketer, you need to supply data to those tools for maximum ROI, but you have to do it in a HIPAA-compliant way. Freshpaint unlocks that ability.Â Book a demoHow Do Tracking Technologies Violate HIPAA?Â It all comes down to Protected Health Information, or PHI, which is any of the eighteen HIPAA identifiers combined with specific health information.Â Name and email are obvious identifiers, but native trackers automatically collect IP addresses and device IDs, which are also considered identifiers.When it comes to your website, visits to a page about a specific condition, a search for a doctor, or booking an appointment would be considered health information.When you combine the two ingredients and share that data with a destination that is not HIPAA-compliant, this is where you run the risk of privacy violations. And thatâs exactly what the tracking technologies on your website do.Keep Using Existing Tools By Replacing Native Trackers With FreshpaintFreshpaint replaces all of your non-compliant tracking technologies to prevent advertising and analytics tools from ever getting PHI.Book A DemoCollect Data Using a BAA-Supported PlatformFreshpaint signs a Business Associate Agreement, or BAA, with your healthcare organization so that you can centralize website data collection in one HIPAA-compliant platform.Â Book a demoMake Your Entire Tech Stack Safe By DefaultFreshpaint eliminates human error by blocking data to tools that are not HIPAA-compliant by default.
