Secure for every user, every time








            Granular Audit logs, in your SIEM
          










Granular audit logs on all data shared with AI providers, back to the source system. Understand who is sharing what data, with whom, with full transparency into the MSAs and Terms of Service governing that data. Interact with these logs in Credal or your SIEM tool of choice, like DataDog or Splunk.








            Frictionless sensitive data redaction
          










Redact sensitive keywords, phrases, regexes, or entire categories of data (PII, PHI, Bank account numbers etc.) before the data leaves your organization. Credal keeps track of any redactions, reinserting the original information when the user views the LLM response, ensuring a totally seamless user experience. Full control for InfoSec teams, frictionless for end users. 








            Automatically enforced Acceptable Use Policies
          










Credal allows you to define your own Acceptable use policies, and set all usage outside of the prescribed policy to automatically trigger warnings or outright blocks. Users overidding warnings are audit logged, and these warnings can be applied to both API, UI, or Slackbot usage.








            Fully mirrored permissions syncing
          










Credal automatically tracks who has access to each Google document, Confluence page, or Slack channel -- providing relevant context for the LLM while still respecting your organization's source system permissions. View and manage your organization’s synced data in the Credal Data Catalog.








            BYOI (Bring Your Own Infrastructure) options
          










Credal interoperates with your infrastructure. Credal can be deployed in your Cloud or Kubernetes cluster, leveraging your existing investments in Azure OpenAI, OpenAI Foundry, Anthropic, Bard, or Open Source models. Alternatively, our SaaS offering comes with all of these options out of the box, including MSAs and DPAs with all the major LLM providers.








            SAML/SCIM
          










Enterprise friendly auth. Fully integrate with your SAML 2.0 and SCIM identity provider, like Okta, to provide IT with the security functionality they rely on and your users with a frictionless experience.








              And more...
          










Credal comes with a litany of advanced Enterprise Administration features too numerous to list here. A few examples include cost controls  per API token, Usage analytics, AI adoption benchmarking, and much more. Contact us to find out more.


















Loved by developers



The Credal, and all of its security features, are backwards-compatible with OpenAI and Anthropic. This means you can add Credal’s security benefits to your app, without significant code changes. Developers continue to take advantage of official client libraries (Python, Node.js, etc), substituting endpoint & API key, to build apps on top of enterprise data while ensuring your data remains secure.

The initial pilot grew to an enterprise deal so critical to the customer's business, that "Palantir going bankrupt" was mentioned as a risk on their S1 filing.
