      Something(s) new.
    


      I build and invest in solutions that move the needle for healthcare. Other interests include the future of climate, creators, and connections. 
    

 
      I was the first business hire at Capable Health
      and a Venture Fellow at
      Susa Ventures. I've also crafted strategies to increase STEM education at
      Luminary Labs,
      stood up an investment fund for the gender team at
      UNICEF, shipped features
      to improve internet security at
      Intel, and researched
      how to make our cities more vibrant places to live at
      Sidewalk Labs.
    


      I have a penchant for DIY crafts, kitschy vases, and dim
      sum.
