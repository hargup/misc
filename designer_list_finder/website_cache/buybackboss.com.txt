Questions Before Selling Your Phone?
You have questions – we have answers. Here are some of the most common questions customers ask before selling their devices. If you can’t find the answer to your question below, just reach out to our friendly support team.








How do I get a quote?

Getting a cash offer for your device is incredibly simple. Go to our quoting page, tell us a little bit about your phone, and we will give you an instant offer! The process is incredibly easy and you can get a quote in less than 30 seconds.





How do I ship my device?

After you accept your offer and go through the checkout process, you will be provided a free shipping label. Pack your phone safely in a box, slap on that free shipping label, and send your phone into Buyback Boss.





How long is my offer valid for?

We offer a 14-day price lock, meaning if we receive your phone within 14 days, the price you were quoted is the price you will get. No requotes – no bait and switch.





 Can I sell multiple devices in one order? 

Absolutely! Selling with Buyback Boss is fast and easy – may as well sell as many devices as you can. Simply add all of your devices to your cart and go through the checkout process.





 Am I obligated to sell if I place an order?


No, you can cancel your order at any time with no penalties whatsoever.






 How do payments work?


We offer 3 convenient payment options. You can receive an online payment through PayPal, Gift Card, or a direct transfer into your bank account! Payments are processed after we receive and inspect your device(s). 






Why should I sell to Buyback Boss over an online marketplace?

Selling with Buyback Boss offers convenience, speed, and security. You don’t need to create any online listings, wait for buyers, or meet strangers in public. You can get an instant quote online, ship your phone in, and get paid. We even buy used and broken phones that may be difficult to sell on traditional marketplaces.





How is Buyback Boss different from an iPhone trade-in program?

iPhone trade-in programs are generally carrier-specific and come with more limitations. With trade-in programs, you can only trade in your phone during certain time periods (i.e. every two years). Additionally, many trade-in programs do not buy old and broken iPhones. At Buyback Boss, we buy it all! We buy phones in any condition from any provider. You can get cash for your iPhone without having to lock into a contract with a carrier.












Why Sell to Buyback Boss?
Buyback Boss is the #1 online phone buyback program. We’re constantly working to exceed customers expectations and provide the absolute best experiences possible! We know that choosing an online buyback program can be difficult, so we tried to make the decision as easy as possible. Here are a few reasons our customers love us:
