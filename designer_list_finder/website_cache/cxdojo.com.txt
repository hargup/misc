COMPATIBILITY & INTEGRATIONS










WHAT WE ARE GOOD AT Are you struggling to reduce the time your legal department spends on low-value repetitive work? Do you need a single point of control for the abundance of tools your teams use? Or, maybe, you avoid using legal technology at all because it is too ‘innovative’, not flexible enough, or poses security risks?
CXDojo is good at solving intricate tasks, and we actually solved all of the above problems for our customers before.
We never jump into transformational action immediately. Our team first tries to understand where exactly the pain point lies and only then identify ways how to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and overall productivity. We analyze how the law firm operates, perform comprehensive research on the users, work out a relevant solution, and verify how effective it is for both those using it and the business itself.



WHAT OUR CLIENTS SAY 

GAMING EMULATOR Owner
I don't think there's anything they can improve on — I got exactly what I needed, and they were a great partner. Their designers were great at understanding my needs and bringing in the right people to fill my needs — I’d love to work with them again.



ENDORSEMENT PLATFORM CEO
I really appreciate how involved they are in the project. They integrate themselves into each process to see all interdependencies and make sure they coordinate efforts effectively. A true partner, CXDojo is hands-on, available, and transparent.
