Preparing Our Students to Make Meaningful Contributions to the World





 




 

Student Spotlight: Jorge Cueto MS '18, Computer Science
"Stanford not only gave me hope, it gave me the incredible gift to be able to dream bigger and then turn those dreams into reality..."Read Jorge Cueto's Story





 



CS Degree ProgramsOur main educational goal is to prepare students for a rapidly changing world. Undergraduate students have the option of declaring a Bachelor of Science or a Minor in Computer Science. Graduate students have the opportunity to pursue a Master's or PhD degree in Computer Science. The Master's degree is a terminal professional degree. The PhD is for those who desire a research or teaching career.
 






 



A Gateway to Opportunity & InnovationStanford Computer Science cultivates an expansive range of research opportunities and a renowned group of faculty. Here, discoveries that impact the world spring from the diverse perspectives and life experiences of our community of students, faculty, and staff.
