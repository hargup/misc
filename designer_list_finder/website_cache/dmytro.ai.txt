Dmytro Mishkin
Computer vision and deep learning consultant, PhD

 I save your time and money by advising directions that are more suitable, from a performance, sustainability, and business perspective. While the current frameworks allow good software engineers to replace domain experts in computer vision, when it comes to implementation, expertise is required to decide, which should and, more importantly, should not be implemented.  I currently do not take projects









Recent consulting projects

realtime object tracking for augmented reality
camera localization for virtual reality
deep genomics
anomaly detection for material quality inspection
image recommendation for fashion






Since 2019





Serve as volunteer Member of the Expert Committee on Artificial Intelligence at Ministry of Digital Transformation Of Ukraine. Areas of responsibility: science and education.




2019 — 2020


Co-founder of the Eastern European Computer Vision Conference. We running the largest computer vision conference in Eastern Europe to connect industrial and academic worlds.







Since 2016





Have started Ukrainian Research Group "Szkocka" is an initiative to promote and advance Ukrainian science. It is a platform for cooperation between researchers and supervisors on doing high-quality academic research. It is non-government organization free from bureaucracy and regulations, it exists due to free cooperation and donations.
We supervise and fund students, PhD students and volunteers research in computer vision and machine learning area. Group is named after Lviv mathematician community in 1930s 




2015 — 2021


I did my PhD at CTU in Prague under supervision of Prof. Jiri Matas to deepen and expand my expertise in computer vision and machine learning. My research is mostly devoted to wide baseline stereo and local features: the workhorse of 3D reconstuction, SLAM and image retrieval. During the study, I have done reserch internship at Intel Labs Munich, where I studied classical and learning-based navigation algorithms. 
 My PhD thesis "Learning and Crafting for the Wide Multiple Baseline Stereo got Dean's  Prize, Rector's prize and got into the final of Antonín Svoboda Award for the Best Ph.D. Thesis.
I am the maintainer of the open source Kornia library — OpenCV in PyTorch.







2014 — 2017





Co-founder and CTO of Clear Research. Team under my supervision have developed a mobile visual commerce system for madora.co app.
        In particular:

bags and shoes recommendation engine, based on actual photos of things user like, or already have;
proprietary deep learning powered similarity search engine, based on user tap on camera photo;
proprietary algorithm, which discovers potential items to sell, based on photo and description from supplier web-page;
proprietary automatic image adjustment algorithm, so all things we sell, have standardized view and and the photos are of desired quality, even the items are from different suppliers





2012 — 2013


Worked as visiting researcher at Center of Machine perception at CTU in Prague. I have developed MODS - the state-of-the-art method for the wide baseline stereo matching under the extreme viewpoint change.







2011 — 2014





Was an Assistant Professor at National Technical University of Ukraine "KPI". I taught masters and undergraduate courses:

Image recognition
Satellite imagery processing
Microcontroller systems
