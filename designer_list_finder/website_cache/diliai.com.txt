Screen More Deals, Faster 



Dili can automatically pull new deals that arrive in your inbox and pull out the most relevant facts from preliminary deal materials. Using generative AI, this information is compared against a strucutred database of every previous deal your firm has seen. Dili then prepares  a list of comparable companies and red flags, which allow you to evaluate deals at a glance - and do more deals faster.

Catch Red Flags Early



With Dili’s deep due diligence capabilities, you can now find issues that may not be easily discoverable within a target company’s data room. By reading through every file in detail, Dili can find asset-liability mismatches, legal clauses and other causes of concern that could materially affect your deal.
