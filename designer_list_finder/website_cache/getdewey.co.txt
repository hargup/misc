Break Twitter API limits

                        Go back to the very first bookmark you've ever saved on Twitter. Twitter API has an 800 bookmark limit for
                        sync‚Äîsounds like a ‚Äòthem‚Äô problem.

                            Twitter bookmarks, and (more importantly) the Dewey Chrome extension has been a game-changer for me when it
                            comes to "doing research" ü§©
                        

                        I'd pay üíµüíµ if there was an anonymized repository of bookmarked tweets segregated by topics, account followers,
                        'no. of times bookmarked' üôåüèΩ

                            Have you bookmarked so many tweets that you can't find that one specific tweet when needed?
                        
                        Fret no more. Use @getdewey
                        to:
                        - keep your bookmarked tweets sorted in different folders
                        - remember purpose of saving them with annotations
                        - share your collections publicly

                        I've been using the Dewey Chrome Ext to categorize my Twitter bookmarks. so far it's pretty cool. Here I have all my
                        "torch" stunts together

                            This is brilliant. A dashboard for your Twitter Bookmarks that lets you search, sort, tag, and share
                            collections. You can even export Bookmarks to a note-taking app!
                        

                        Props to @getdewey
                        for helping make Twitter Bookmarks more user-friendly.

                        Love Twitter - for many years - but the product team needs to focus on value-added features.

                            Because Twitter seems a bit unstable at the moment, I thought I'd back up my account - would be sad to lose
                            track of
                            the wonderful research I've found on here.
                        
                        I can recommend @getdewey
                        for bookmarks - for everything else, you can download an archive of your data via settings.
