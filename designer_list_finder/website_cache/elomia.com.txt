It feels like it knows me better than I know myself sometimes."personElomia UserJanuary 2023"I got my first job during the pandemic and, recently, it was my first time ever going into an office. I had really bad social anxiety, so my therapist recommended I try out Elomia. It helped me to manage my anxious thoughts in real-time, so I didn't have to wait until my next session to discuss them."personElomia UserNovember 2021"I had difficulty finding the words to express myself to my boss and I needed quick advice, so I decided to try Elomia.
