I love the customizable landing page & how easy it is to manage your offerings & events. Calendly has way too many menus for me."Alaina, Tarot Reader"I love the new options Dayslice offers to me and my clients! I do tutoring online so I can connect directly to Zoom and keep my clients."Anne, Tutor "Dayslice is by far the best way to schedule.  The elimination of the back-and-forth of traditional scheduling has streamlined my business and made it so I can focus on tutoring instead of scheduling. My favorite feature is automatic text reminders, which effectively prevent no-shows. Payment is also a breeze, with Dayslice and Stripe handling all of the tedium of collecting payment for sessions."JD, Tutor"The people at Dayslice are warm, helpful and always wanting to improveâ¦The simple interface and empathetic features make it interesting to use and help me focus on my work. All in all, Dayslice addresses important challenges that arise and makes the overall experience a smooth one."Shaantanu, Tutor"Love the Magic share feature, the designs are so cute! ð â¨â¨â¨â¨Itâs so much better than doing it myself in Canva. I saved soooo much time! Dayslice is fun to use and innovative-- highly recommend it!"Mishka, Videographer "Dayslice has transformed my ability to save time and energy scheduling with new and returning clients. Its ease of use, integration and customizable pages meet all of my needsâ¦The team is extremely supportive and can help you think through ways to maximize this tool in ways that you might not have thought of to support your business."Nafasi, Financial Wellness Coach Get in touchGet in touchGet in touchðStill have questions?Weâre here to guide you on anything youâre still wondering about, such as:Weâre here to guide you on anything youâre still wondering about, such as:- Can I have support setting up my booking page?- How would this fit into my current toolbox?- How does Dayslice compare to other solutions?Schedule a chatðStill have questions?Weâre here to guide you on anything youâre still wondering about, such as:- Can I have support setting up my booking page?- How would this fit into my current toolbox?- How does Dayslice compare to other solutions?Schedule a chatâ¡ï¸Test drive Dayslice for freeSign up for freeLet's chatsolutionsIndependent TutorsWyzant TutorsMusic TeachersHealth & WellnessInstructorsSchedulingMarketingGoogle CalendarStripePayPalcompareVs.
