üëãüèª Howdy, I'm Ethan. Let's explore.

        I'm passionate about merging product and tech to fix societal problems
        through empathy,
        ideation, and iteration.
      
I've worn many hats - engineer, product manager, sales leader, and startup builder. Despite
        setbacks, I'll always be a builder.
      
Recently, I launched MongoDB's search
          platform. Now, I'm on a mission to equip anyone with deep
        multimodal search capabilities in a
          single line of code.

I'm all about work/life balance and love exploring the great outdoors with my pup through mountain biking, backpacking,
        kayaking, and climbing.
I learned electricals, plumbing, woodwork and
        metalwork to equip a badass camper van for off-grid work and travel.
Check out vanlifecoder for the full build journal, travel log and cost
        breakdown. Who knows, maybe it'll
        inspire you to pursue your own epic BHAG!
