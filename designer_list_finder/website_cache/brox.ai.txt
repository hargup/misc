Get the benefits of qual. but at the scale of quant. Massive database and massive panel accessWeâre building an enormous database of profiled audiences, quantitative data and qualitative responses, which we can supplement almost instantly with access to consumer and B2B panels in nearly every market.Automating insight creationCrucially we can distill this down and synthesize this into statistically relevant easy to access insights in a flash, no more hours wasted crawling through verbatims or piecing together reports.How we do thisHow it worksWe start with open ended survey questionsInstead of focussing on asking the most specific questions we believe we get better data by asking more general open ended questions and encouraging long form responses.We turn this into structured dataWeâre then able to take these responses and parse them into structured quantified data as well as internally consistent qualitative data. This is the real magic as our data letâs us go beyond just the what and tell you the why and at scale.Open question survey responseAs far as Apple, I like them as a company. Particularly think Apple is a good-quality company with high quality products. What I like about Apple is that they always come up with new things. They're always building new products. Even more technology and advanced.As far as anything I don't like about Apple it is just that the products are fairly pricey. I own an iPad and also an iPhone. I'm considering upgrading my phone because I have an older model. Iâm thinking of getting the iPhone 13, I currently have the iPhone 11 but I'm trying to spend less money as I'm worried about the economy and maybe even my jobâ¦Automatically extracted insightsAware of AppleYesOwns Apple productsYesFan of AppleYesFan of AppleYesThings they like about AppleInnovative, Advance, Cutting EdgeThings they Don't like about AppleExpensiveApple products they owniPad, iPhoneConsidering upgradingYesReason for upgradingOld phoneReason for not upgradingWorried about the economyWhich device are they considering upgradingiPhone 13How much do they like their iPhone (0/10)9What are they most worried aboutThey are worried about their jobCreate beautiful, pertinent, and actionable insights fastWeâre able to turn these insights reports, trackers and custom dashboards almost instantly, surfacing the most important insights, and in the  case of trackers and dashboards dig deeper and segment and cut the data just the way you like it.Apple Net Consider PurchasingResponses for the selected range34 responsesMain reasonsEconomy, inflation, expensive, new featuresWhat do people think about inflation/economy?15%Will recover soon32%War will make it worse12%Energy bills are risingWhy you should use usBeyond just what people think but whyOur research goes beyond just what people think, but tells you why, itâs not enough to know whether someone is aware of your brand or is likely to buy something but the value comes from knowing why:e.g. We saw that intent to purchase a new iphone decreased this year as nearly every brand tracker showed but weâre able to say why: âpeople are worried about their jobs because Putin is a dick&&edâ - to summarize.Statistically significantWe work constantly to make sure that any insight generated is statistically significant and that we can scale it to nat pop representativeness or the demographic skew of your choice.Fast and Rich insightsWe can get really rich insights really quickly.Itâs not instant but we can get you qual. level rich insights from thousands of people in a few days, and all distilled into easy to digest reports.Ex Post Facto AnalysisNot only are our insights fast and rich but because of the way we collect and process data we can allow you do to do analysis after the fact. As we get so many more insights per panelists compared to a normal survey response, you donât have to worry as much about asking exactly the right questions.Huge reach in any language and countryWe work with established panel partners in nearly every market.
