I have been able to create a subsequent event using additional date formatters based on the original event. Where I need helpCurrently I am trying to automate the process of creating more subsequent events. I would like to just be able to create some kind of loop and specify the number of times to repeat in order to create 1 years worth of recurring events. For context, the recurrence will be weekly, biweekly, and monthly; I’m hoping that I can use the same solution for all and provide a different date formatter and number of loops for each case.  ToolsWebflow: Form submissionsA032 hours agoTheBishopAGBeginner TroubleshootingMapping Google Lead Form Questions to Action Fields in ZapHi, I’m trying to map the “Qualifying Questions” that I added to my Google Lead Forms, to my Zap/Google Spreadsheet, but the “Qualifying Questions” (and multiple choice) fields don’t appear in the Action Fields in the Zap, so I can’t assign them to the columns in my Google Spreadsheet. Any help would be appreciated.28T6 hours agoKkgeary1252New How Do IRandomize Survey Responses - Publish on Website I am looking to embedd a one question survey on my website, then randomize all the answers to show just one (publicly) with a shuffle button to randomize again.

It works pretty fine. I wuld like to tune it a little bit.Actually I want the email to be created only when value of  cell D2 falls below zero. In the google Sheet i put a formula that says … IF( D2 is greater than 0, False, “D2”) In this way zap doesen’t gets triggered at every change of data but if the value of D2 falls  below 0 ZAP gerts triggered, but it happens also when D2 raise again from zero. (i.e friend top up their credit of a car we are using toghether)Can you suggest a way so that  zap is triggered only when value falls below zero?I cannot think of anything.Thanks027 hours agoHi there!
