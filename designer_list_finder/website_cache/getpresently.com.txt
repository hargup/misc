Group gifting
is better gifting









We handle the stressful parts so you can focus on the 🥳 


















Easily get people together to celebrate, regardless of distance 



















Keep all communications and funds in one place 



















Help others give a meaningful gift without breaking the bank 



















Make conscious consumerism an easy choice 






















Group celebrations simplified







Step 1: Pick a group gift or card


No credit card needed for sign up. Once you pick your gift type, we’ll create a custom page dedicated to your celebration with photos, messages, and occasion details.


Step 2: Invite contributors to participate


We’ll send reminders for you and keep track of all contributions and messages from your organizer dashboard – everything in one place.


Step 3: Get notified when the recipient opens the gift!


We’ll share the group gift and card with the recipient on the special day! Presently takes care of all purchasing and delivering, but organizers can choose to redeem the group funds to purchase the gift, too.

From friends to coworkers, Presently has helped groups of all sizes celebrate together















"Presently is a great platform, it's very easy to create cards to share in our organization since we are no longer in person and great to include everyone now as we are national and always felt some folks were left off when signing cards & gifts in-person previously. Highly recommend!"
 Alex H., Chief of StaffGathered $1205 across 3 group gifts 




"Simple, easy, quick! Much better than trying to coordinate in-person to sign a card, gather funds, etc."
 Anonymous contributor 








"Quick, easy, painless.  
A suitable substitute during a pandemic for handing someone a gift with a hug.  
(I miss the hugs the most!)"
 Kimball W., Principal Engineer at Tech CompanyContributed to a coworker's farewell gift 




“Presently made it easy for me to coordinate with teammates across the globe to create a truly special memory for my manager. I am so grateful that this platform exists, especially during a time when celebrations are happening a little bit differently than they usually are.”
 Ariel C., Manager at Business InsiderGathered $530 from 20 contributors 








"Reaching the birthday gal’s friends all over the world who could contribute with two clicks wouldn't have been possible without Presently. We shared the gift page with her on the day of her birthday and she was overjoyed!"
 Elisa B., Santa CruzGathered $909 from 27 contributors 




“I really like how it automates the process. No more having to collect funds via Paypal from everyone. Presently was very easy to set up for a group gift I was organizing. The best part was that the recipient could choose from a range of options rather than a few. This makes Presently more appealing and the customer service is friendly and quick to get back. Definitely my go-to for digital cards and gifts now.”
 Repeat OrganizerGathered over $1100 from 50 contributors

“It’s a super handy tool while we are all working from home! Way better than Venmo.”

“I always understood why group gifting was better from a feature perspective, but it didn’t hit emotionally until I used it for a friend.”
 Garrett M., OklahomaParticipated in a group gift 








“Great tool! I was sent a card to sign for a friend's birthday during the pandemic. Great way to provide something tangible for them on a day that not everyone could get together. Excellent alternative!”
