      I did my PhD in Machine Learning and Robotics from 2018 to 2022 at the ETH Zürich, under Prof. Siegwart.
    

      I'm interested in embodied AI - How can robotics help us better understand the ingredients of intelligence?
      My main research question during the PhD was how algorithms can create powerful, predictive models of the world from unlabeled data, and use them in decision making.
      I'm willing to bet that big breakthroughs will result from 1) better understanding of large fundamental models 2) research on integrating high-level reasoning (for example large multi-modal models) into low level systems (Perception, SLAM, Controls).
    





      I now work at mesh.ch, where I apply robotics and ML research to help make construction less material and labor intensive.
