WHAT WE DO

                               Bhartiya Mandal Foundation (BMF) is a nonprofit organization built on the pillars of Indian cultural awareness and community service.  Our goal is to create an institution to preserve our Indian-American heritage through various cultural and religious events while also giving back to the wider local San Francisco Bay Area community.

WHO WE ARE

Our Board of Directors consists of many second generation Indian Americans who are stalwarts of the local community and industry.

Giving Back To The Community














BMF values giving back to our local San Francisco Bay Area community. We coordinate events and activities such as donation drives, community clean up activities, and charitable events for those in our local community who are less fortunate. BMF looks to create innovative approaches to impart social change for the advancement of all peoples while also looking to affirm a sense of Indian-American identity and cultural values.
