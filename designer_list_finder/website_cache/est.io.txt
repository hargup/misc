We specialize in efficiency: Just one or two Elevator Speech Training sessions will enhance your persuasiveness, boost your confidence, and simplify communicating complex subjects. Employing a hybrid training approach, AI chatbot Elvy from our ElevatorSpeech.AI platform preps you before your face-to-face with Marc. Elvy can even lead standalone, one-on-one training sessions for larger organizations who want to train their entire staff – regardless of scale. 
Curious? Let’s talk.












What You Get










 
Have a framework for any speaking situation.
  Our training offers you the 10-step Elevator Speech Framework that you can use as a skeleton structure to master any speaking situation, including one-on-one conversations. It makes preparing for or even winging a speaking challenge as easy as painting by numbers. 






 
Increase confidence and gravitas.
  Anxiety about public speaking is natural because our brains are hard-wired to fear rejection. The training offers a systematic approach to managing your fear not by trying to vanquish it but by befriending it. In the process, you will also learn tools to “prime your brain” before entering a speaking situation. 






 
Discover how to be most interesting.
  When making a first impression, being interesting is far more critical than being informative. The unique way we go about our work is often more interesting than what we do. The training offers a framework to identify what is most interesting about your work and for communicating it effectively. 








 
Get your listeners to trust you.
  In all situations, mutual trust is crucial for people to realize the full potential of collaboration and connection. The training gives you an easy, surprising, and highly effective step-by-step approach for getting your listeners to experience a “trust boost” towards you. 






 
Solve the challenge of having too much to say.
  A common challenge our clients experience is having to convey to listeners the complexity and sheer volume of their work. The training offers a solution to this problem. It leaves your listeners looking forward to continuing the conversation with you. It even turns them into messengers to others about your work. 






 
Create a frame of relevance and purpose.
  Everyone focuses on their day-to-day work. That focus often becomes the first thing we discuss when explaining what we do. The Elevator Speech Framework helps ensure that you step back at the beginning of speaking situations to answer the question, “why does it all matter?” 










How We Work, Step by Step










 
#1: We learn about you.
  We do research about your work and your professional background to customize the training to your specific needs and context. 






 
#2: You prepare a bit.
  Preparing is as quick as answering these three short questions. If you want to prepare more deeply, simply use our preparation worksheet. 






 
#3: We do the training.
  The training comprises one or two Zoom calls. Each requires one hour and is one-on-one. Expect a fun workshop atmosphere where trial and error is OK. 






 
#4: We follow up.
  After the session, we’ll send you an email with a summary of your specific key take-aways. We’ll touch base a couple times a year to reinforce what you’ve learned.
