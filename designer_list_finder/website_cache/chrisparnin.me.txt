About
 I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University.   
					My research interests are in software engineering and human interactions, including programmer cognition, automated infrastructure, and software ecosystems.
					My students work in the alt-code lab, known for its industrial-strength awesomeness. 

					I teach the software engineering and devops courses.
				
Our research program in Software Engineering is ranked #3 in the world.
				If you're interested in these research areas, look at what it takes to join the lab, and apply to the NCSU PhD in Software Engineering!
