					Does Multiple Mating Help Spotted Lanternflies Spread?  				


Producing offspring from multiple fathers can add much-needed genetic diversity to populations of invasive insects, which often arise from a small number of individuals. New research confirms such multiple paternity occurs in spotted lanternflies, though to what degree it aids their spread needs further study.

					How Some Insects Turn Plants Into Pollution Detectors				

A wide variety of insects cause their host plants to form protective galls. These abnormal growths are rich in nutrients—as well as contaminants the plant might absorb from the soil. New research shows these insect-induced galls can double as highly sensitive pollution detectors.




 



					Safeguarding Biodiversity: An Entomologist’s Goal as Government Policy Analyst  				

Meet entomologist Emily Sandall, Ph.D., science policy analyst with the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service focusing on biodiversity, deforestation, and land use, and subject of the next installment of our "Standout Early Career Professionals" series.




 



					Desert Decomposers: The Insects That Thrive in Decaying Cacti				

In arid ecosystems, cacti are primary resources for insects and arthropods that depend on dead or decaying wood. A new review explores this relationship and its ecological implications.




 



					Stink Bug Saliva: A Potent Mix to Bypass Plant Defenses				

The biochemical conflict between plants and the insects that eat them is vastly complex, as illustrated by new research identifying nearly 700 proteins in the saliva of just five stink bug species, many of which play potential roles in suppressing or deactivating plants' own chemical defenses.

					Curious About Edible Insects? There’s a Free Online Course for That				

The first-ever massive open online course (MOOC) on edible insects was launched in March, based on one entomologist's popular university course. Learn more about the development of the "Edible Insects" MOOC and what it offers to online learners around the world.




 



					Spider Solidarity: Scientists Discover New Species With Unprecedented Social Behavior				

Sociality in spiders is quite rare, but a new species found in Madagascar takes it a step further. Isoxya manangona kite spiders build large colonies of webs, all connected by a central silk line where multiple adult males gather harmoniously. Researchers suggest the males could be "lekking," gathering in a group to perform mating displays for females, a behavior never before seen in spiders.




 



					In Defense of Clothes Moths, Marvels of Evolution				

Though they cause headaches for dining on your wardrobe, webbing clothes moths are unique creatures with fascinating specialized biology. They can eat hair and metabolize their own water. They can chew through plastic and digest mercury. And that's not all. An entomologist studying these moths makes a case for appreciating their evolutionary feats.




 



					Brown Widow Spiders’ Aggression Likely Driver of Black Widow Decline				

Black widow spiders have earned a fearsome reputation for their venomous bite. But in parts of the southern U.S. these spiders have much to fear themselves—from spider relatives who really don't like their company. A new study shows that brown widow spiders, of a species in the same genus, have a striking propensity to seek out and kill nearby black widows.

					An Essential U.S. Pesticide Database is Disappearing				


Responsible use of pesticides depends in part on understanding where and when they’re used and their impacts on the environment. However, a key source of information on pesticide usage is being scaled back, which could leave scientists and the public in the dark.

					A Fruitful Discussion: Field Tour Gathers Insect Biocontrol Community				

The ESA Plant-Insect Ecosystems Section field tour series returned in May 2022, convening experts and practitioners from research, industry, and government focused on insect biological control, with in-person demonstrations and discussions featuring the Washington state tree fruit industry.




 



					Virtual Outreach: How Students Bring an Insect Zoo to an Entire State				

The Kansas State University Insect Zoo has long been an on-campus attraction, but a student entomology club's efforts to create virtual engagement opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic have built a new model for outreach that continues to spread the educational value of the Insect Zoo far and wide.




 



					Tick Blitz: How Community Science is Helping New York State Monitor Ticks				

With a little bit of training, 59 citizen scientists in New York collected more than 3,700 ticks across 15 counties in a two-week period in the summer of 2021, greatly expanding the reach of professional tick researchers at the Northeast Regional Center for Excellence in Vector-Borne Diseases. The "New York State Tick Blitz" is now an annual project and a model that tick-surveillance programs elsewhere can follow.




 



					Why Entomology Students Should Get Active in Education and Outreach				

Getting people excited about insect science and inspiring the next generation of entomologists are worthy goals on their own, but leading education and outreach programs can be a valuable professional experience for any entomology student, as well. One entomology master's student shares her experience and advice on getting involved in community education and outreach.

					Even on Farms, Bees Look For a Balanced Diet				

A study of managed bumble bees and honey bees on a blueberry farm finds that most of the pollen they collect comes from other plants, suggesting that supplementing crops with a diversity of nearby plant types makes for healthier bees.

					Wolbachia in Cockroaches: A New Paradigm for Urban Pest Management?				


Bacteria in the genus Wolbachia are commonly found living within insects, but their presence in cockroaches has not been thoroughly explored. A new study finds Wolbachia in four of 16 cockroach species across three families, and researchers hope further study may open doors to new management methods for pest cockroach species.

					New Study Improves Sterile Insect Technique for Mosquitoes				

Researchers in Florida find that male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes live longer when irradiated as adults rather than pupae, an important advance in protocols for deploying the sterile insect technique to manage wild populations of disease-transmitting mosquitoes.

					Nuisance Arthropods: Sticky Traps Useful in Accurate Detection in Homes, Study Shows				

Arthropods that aren't of medical or economic concern can often still be a nuisance in homes, but they're comparatively under-studied. New research on such "nuisance arthropods" in homes shows the utility of sticky traps in detection—and stark differences in what residents might report observing versus the arthropods that are actually there.




 



					Mosquito Sprays Can Reduce West Nile Virus Risk, Even If Population Numbers Don’t Drop				

In a new study on truck-mounted mosquito-control sprays, the proportion of local mosquito populations that could potentially carry West Nile virus decreased after treatments, even though overall numbers of mosquitoes weren't affected—an "invisible" but positive sign about the utility of such mosquito management efforts.




 



					Here We Go Again: Meet the Elm Zigzag Sawfly, Another Non-Native Forest Pest				

The elm zigzag sawfly (Aproceros leucopoda) is now established in several places in North America. This non-native forest pest can be a threat to elm species and hybrids and is capable of large defoliation events. Will it turn into a full-blown invasive species, or simply co-exist with native herbivores in natural and urban forests? At this point, we don't know. A new review highlights elm zigzag sawfly biology, ecology, and management strategies in the U.S.
