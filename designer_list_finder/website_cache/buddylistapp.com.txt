We're all friends here, but we want to start off on the right foot, so in order to keep your spot here, we ask our buddies to:                        Be Complete                  Make sure you fill out your form fully with accurate, up-to-date information.

Be Communicative                  It's okay if something isn't the right fit, just keep your buddies updated in a timely way so that you both can move forward. If you aren't responsive to your buddies, we'll have to say goodbye.                       Be Cool                  No jerks, creeps, or spam allowed.
