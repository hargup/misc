Hi! I’m Bex. I’m a Somatic Movement Educator and E-RYT 500+.

Soma Nidra: Cellular Breathing9 MinutesSoma Nidra is my somatic approach to Yoga Nidra. This multi-scale body trip explores the embodied anatomy of your breath, from whole-body to cellular and back again. Grab a blanket or your mat, lie down, and get comfortable. Part of my growing series of free mini practices.



Samavṛtti Breath Practice9 MinutesI love this brief and simple prāṇāyāma (breathwork) practice. Samavṛtti (समवृत्ति) means “same movement,” “equanimity,” or “equable” in sanskrit. For me, this simple technique (and a supported backbend as I demonstrate) are always a welcome reset in the middle of my day, or a calming mini practice at night before bed. Part of my growing series of free mini practices.

Dan, Maine“I did a foam rolling class with Bex and it was deep and informative, rigorous and revelatory —  and gave me some new techniques I’ve incorporated into my regular somatic repertoire. If you’re even a little bit curious I recommend checking it out.”



Erin, Brooklyn, NY“Bex's approach to yoga has a contagious reverence for and wonder about the body and mind that make her sequences, phrasing, classes, and playlists a delight. I'm so grateful for this New Moon offering, and I go whenever I can.”



Grace, Davis, CA“Bex is so wonderful to study with. She is attuned and insightful, engaging and engaged. Bex's invitation to movement exploration is deeply thoughtful. A real gift!”



Sylvia, Davis, CA“What an incredible class and teacher! This was my first formal rolling class and she covered proper technique and safety. I have constant back pain if I don't take care of it and this class was fabulous. Now I have techniques I can continue using in the future.”



Laura, Brooklyn, NY“As expected from Bex, the workshop was fascinating, challenging and deeply restorative. I was able to hold the somatic experience of the body on a cellular level for the entire practice. This concept breathed new life into the "root down to lift up" paradigm and does extend into thinking about the hierarchical systems of our bodies, communities and beyond-- which by examining opens them up for change. It was insightful & enjoyable placing body awareness into its smallest parts for once. Furthermore, with this particular headstand instruction, my neck felt safer and freer than it normally does.”



Helen, Brooklyn, NY“This was such a necessary experience. I’ve had the privilege of taking class with Bex before, and was so excited to have this opportunity to rest with her guidance, and it was wonderful. I really appreciate Bex’s knowledge that she shares with her students and I find her thoughts and teaching to be very helpful to my yoga practice and to my relationship with self and body.”



Nancy, New York, NY“I began practicing with Bex having a year of previous experience attending several different group classes in the city. I started with Bex in a small group setting and found that my progress, both mentally and physically, began to improve at rates I never would have expected. I went from being the girl who stared wide eyed at the people doing crow and head stand to being able to do the same and even move further into forearm stand and handstand to mention a couple. I always leave class having worked toward something, whether it be a specific pose, a more focused mind, or even just feeling like days of wearing my New York armor of heavy bags has been washed away.I found that Bex’s adjustments, both verbal and physical, were more helpful than other instructors in the past as I saw my posture, strength, and balance drastically improve. I didn’t realize how important verbal cues were until I was able to seamlessly flow from one position to the next without looking up. She has a real knack of “reading the room” as I like to say. When I was in group classes, she was able to work with both beginner and advanced students while making everyone feel like they had a personal practice.  One of my favorite traits about Bex that I’ve never seen in another instructor is her own passion for education and sharing that knowledge with her students. She’s taken continued courses in Sanskrit and anatomy, more than most instructors need or want to.  I feel that her continued education in anatomy makes me a little more at ease when pushing myself, knowing that she will make sure that when I do push myself to the limit, I’m not worried about injuring myself. Rebekah is constantly making sure my muscles are working to their maximum without overextending and working through the proper counter-poses to build a well-balanced practice.In addition to my strength, her more scholarly yoga studies have, in turn, helped me to study the spiritual attributes of yoga. I still have a hard time fully letting myself explore the mental and meditative teachings of yoga, but find myself open to the opportunity given Rebekah’s laid back, easy going approach.At this point, almost 4 years later, I am now practicing individually and continuing to see results I never thought were possible. Sometimes I really want  a good workout, other times the opportunity to stretch out worn muscles, and sometimes a more spiritual class following extra stressful days of work. She quickly adjusts her plans and I leave every class feeling extremely fulfilled.”



Joan, Brooklyn, NY“I took Bex's 10am class today and that woman is such an amazing teacher. Like cuckoo crazy awesome. That woman is like perfection on mag wheels.”
