Credit Card FAQs


Find information on Discover cards, how to apply for a credit card online, and more.










How does a credit card work?





A credit card is a revolving loan that you can use to make purchases. Each month you’ll receive a statement telling you how much of the loan you have used and have to pay back. If you pay the statement balance in full by the due date each month, you will not be charged interest on purchases. Otherwise your APR will apply to your unpaid credit card balance and you’ll have interest charges in your next statement. When you apply for a credit card, the credit card issuer will pull your credit report – which could result in a hard inquiry – as one of the factors they use to decide whether to approve your application. Credit cards often provide rewards on purchases, which is usually a percentage of the amount you spent with the card. A credit card comparison shows you different rewards and benefits and can help you find the credit card that’s best for you.






How can I apply for a credit card?





                        If you’re thinking about how to get a credit card, check your credit score to figure out your likely credit card eligibility. Then, a credit card comparison can help you choose the one that’s best for you. It’s always good to check if you’re pre-approved for a card before you apply. Checking if you’re pre-approved won’t harm your credit, but applying for credit cards may impact your credit score. Check to see if you‘re pre-approved.






What should I know before applying online for a credit card?





It’s always good to check if you’re pre-approved to see your likely offers before you apply for a card. While checking if you’re pre-approved won’t hurt your credit, each full application for a credit card may impact your credit score.






Why get a credit card?





There are many reasons to get a credit card: you may decide to apply for a credit card for the rewards, APR (including intro rates) or sign-up offers. Or you might want to build your credit history. Some credit cards like Discover provide $0 Fraud Liability Guarantee, which means you’re never responsible for unauthorized purchases on your Discover Card.5 Also, credit cards often provide extra benefits, like providing helpful alerts on your spending and more.






What are the different types of Discover Cards?





Discover credit cards are available on the Discover it® platform, a set of common benefits we’re committed to providing to every customer. However, the rewards and some extra benefits vary from product to product to be sure we can give different customers what they need.
 
Discover it® Cash Back: earn rewards at different places
 
Discover it® Miles: great for vacations or staycations
 
Discover it® Chrome Gas & Restaurants: earn rewards on road trips
 
Discover it® Secured Credit Card: build your credit history
 
Discover it® Student Cash Back: students earn rewards at different places
 
Discover it® Chrome for Students: students earn rewards at gas stations and restaurants
 
NHL® Discover it®: put your favorite team on your card






How can I get a new credit card from Discover?





You can apply for Discover credit cards at Discover.com or by calling 1-800-DISCOVER (1-800-347-2683). Select from cash back credit cards or travel credit cards. We also have Discover student cards. All our credit cards earn Discover rewards on every purchase. You’ll need to be 18 or older to apply for a card. If you're not yet 21, you will have to apply online. Discover Secured credit card applicants must also apply online.






What is the minimum credit score needed to be approved for a credit card?





Different credit cards require a different credit rating for approval. Some cards are only for people with excellent credit or good credit. Other cards are great if you have fair credit or are building or rebuilding credit. The credit card company will run a credit check as part of its decision to approve your application. It’s a good idea to check your credit score or get a copy of your credit report before applying for a new card.






What credit score is needed to apply for a Discover Credit Card?





Discover card credit score requirements vary by product. In general, the standard Discover it® Card is for people with established credit. But the Discover Secured credit card is built for people looking to build or rebuild their credit with responsible use.4 No matter what, cardmembers earn Discover Card rewards on every purchase.






What is a credit limit for a credit card?





Your credit limit is the maximum amount of the revolving line of credit on your card—or the total amount you can use on your card for purchases, balance transfers, etc. When you apply for a credit card, the bank or credit card company uses a variety of information to decide what credit limit they can offer. As you show responsible credit use, credit card issuers may increase your credit card limit.






How can I view introductory credit card offers and find the best new credit card offers for me?





You may receive credit card offers in the mail, by email or online. Compare your offers by rewards, sign-up bonus, benefits, APR (including introductory rates), fees and credit limits. Look for rewards programs that fit the way you spend: if you know you will use the card for groceries, gas, dining or travel, you may be able to find a card that helps you earn more. And look for a sign-up bonus that doesn’t have a minimum spending amount required to get your extra rewards.






How can I improve my chances for approvals and higher credit limits when I apply for a credit card?





Credit card companies consider a number of factors in their decision to approve your application, including your credit history and your ability to repay. So they may consider your credit score, income and more. One of the simplest helpful credit habits is to make at least the minimum payment for all of your bills on time every month.

Discover Match®: Only from Discover, as of July 2023. We'll match all the Miles rewards you've earned on your credit card from the day your new account is approved through your first 12 consecutive billing periods or 365 days, whichever is longer, and add it to your rewards account within two billing periods. You've earned Miles rewards only when they're processed, which may be after the transaction date. We will not match: rewards that are processed after your match period ends; statement credits; rewards transfers from Discover checking or other deposit accounts; or rewards for accounts that are closed. This promotional offer may not be available in the future and is exclusively for new cardmembers. No purchase minimums.


2% Cash Back at gas and restaurants: You earn a full 2% Cashback Bonus® on your first $1000 in combined purchases at Gas Stations (stand-alone), and Restaurants each calendar quarter. Calendar quarters begin January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1. Purchases at Gas Stations and Restaurants over the quarterly cap, and all other purchases, earn 1% cash back. Gas Station purchases include those made at merchants classified as places that sell automotive gasoline that can be bought at the pump or inside the station, and some public electric vehicle charging stations. Gas Stations affiliated with supermarkets, supercenters, and wholesale clubs may not be eligible. Restaurant purchases include those made at merchants classified as full-service restaurants, cafes, cafeterias, fast-food locations, and restaurant delivery services. Purchases must be made with merchants in the U.S. To qualify for 2%, the purchase transaction date must be before or on the last day of the offer or promotion. For online purchases, the transaction date from the merchant may be the date when the item ships. Rewards are added to your account within two billing periods. Even if a purchase appears to fit in a 2% category, the merchant may not have a merchant category code (MCC) in that category. Merchants and payment processors are assigned an MCC based on their typical products and services. Discover Card does not assign MCCs to merchants. Certain third-party payment accounts and digital wallet transactions may not earn 2% if the technology does not provide sufficient transaction details or a qualifying MCC. Learn more at Discover.com/digitalwallets. See Cashback Bonus Program Terms and Conditions for more information.


Build credit with responsible use: Discover reports your credit history to the three major credit bureaus so it can help build/rebuild your credit if used responsibly. Late payments, delinquencies or other derogatory activity with your credit card accounts and loans may adversely impact your ability to build/rebuild credit.


Minimum Security Deposit: You must make a minimum security deposit of $200 (or more, in increments of $100 up to $2,500), which will equal your requested credit limit. Discover will determine your maximum credit limit by your income and ability to pay.


$0 Fraud Liability: An “unauthorized purchase” is a purchase where you have not given access to your card information to another person or a merchant for one-time or repeated charges. Please use reasonable care to protect your card and do not share it with employees, relatives, or friends. Learn more at Discover.com/fraudFAQ


About product reviews: We calculate the average product rating based on ratings that customers submit. We exclude some reviews from being displayed for reasons such as the customer included profanity, reviewed the wrong product, submitted inappropriate or irrelevant content, or revealed personally identifying information. Reviews are not filtered, edited, or deleted simply because they are negative or are lower rated. If a review is excluded, the associated rating is not calculated in the average product rating.
