We set up South Indiaâs first distribution craft brewery by transforming a once abandoned plywood factory set amid the fields of Nimbekaipura â (literal translation: the village of lemons) into a brewerâs paradise.READÂ MORE

In 2020, we set up our flagship beer garden restaurant nestled under the shade of a 100-year-old Banyan tree beside our production brewery. Our menus are curated and designed to offer homestyle cooking favourites from India and around the world â comfort food with a special Geist twist that pairs best with our beer!
