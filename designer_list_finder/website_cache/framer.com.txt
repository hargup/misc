I wonder how long before it takes a big chunk of the market â especially sites for personal, freelance, and startups.CÃ©dric@cedric_designI've been using the new @framer for quite some time now and I can say it has completely changed building websites without code. Seeing what @jornvandijk, @koenbok and their awesome team are building could disrupt the whole nocode industry like Uber did to taxis.

It's so unreal how small the learning curve is from Figma to @framer. Absolutely loving it.DANNÂ©@DannPettyI learned how to build a website in @Framer! My goal was to learn the basic tools in about 20 minutes a day last week. Nothing fancy. No special design. Just randomness elements that's responsive.

Framer is forever changing the experience of designing for the web. Forget about a design tool. Once you get the basics, you're not on a design tool anymore. You're creating your product/story in the medium itself.
