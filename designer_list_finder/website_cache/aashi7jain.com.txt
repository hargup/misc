And if they don’t have the first, the other two will kill you." --Warren BuffettI am a PM at Google Research on multimodal (images and text) representation learning and generation. Prior to my current role, I was an AI resident at Google. And before that, I got my masters at UC San Diego in the Computer Science department. At UCSD, I was also a member of Berg Lab, advised by Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick. During grad school, my research focused on controlled generation and text-based representation learning.Outside of work, I am currently focused on expanding my knowledge by reading more, increasing mindfulness, and long-distance walking.Want to leave me feedback? Gee, thanks! "We all need people who will give us feedback. That’s how we improve." -Bill GatesReport abusePage detailsPage updated Google SitesReport abuse
