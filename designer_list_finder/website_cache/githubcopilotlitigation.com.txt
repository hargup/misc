This is Matthew Butterick. On OctoÂ­ber 17 I told you that I had teamed up with the amazÂ­ingly excelÂ­lent class-action litÂ­iÂ­gaÂ­tors Joseph Saveri, Cadio ZirÂ­poli, and Travis ManÂ­fredi at the Joseph Saveri Law Firm to invesÂ­tiÂ­gate GitHub CopiÂ­lot.Today, weâve filed a class-action lawÂ­suit in US fedÂ­eral court in San FranÂ­cisco, CA on behalf of a proÂ­posed class of posÂ­siÂ­bly milÂ­lions of GitHub users. We are chalÂ­lengÂ­ing the legalÂ­ity of GitHub CopiÂ­lot (and a related prodÂ­uct, OpenAI Codex, which powÂ­ers CopiÂ­lot). The suit has been filed against a set of defenÂ­dants that includes GitHub, Microsoft (owner of GitHub), and OpenAI.Todayâs filÂ­ings:Class-action comÂ­plaintClass-action comÂ­plaint: AppenÂ­dix AClass-action comÂ­plaint: Exhibit 1By trainÂ­ing their AI sysÂ­tems on pubÂ­lic GitHub reposÂ­iÂ­toÂ­ries (though based on their pubÂ­lic stateÂ­ments, posÂ­siÂ­bly much more) we conÂ­tend that the defenÂ­dants have vioÂ­lated the legal rights of a vast numÂ­ber of creÂ­ators who posted code or other work under cerÂ­tain open-source licenses on GitHub. Which licenses? A set of 11 popÂ­uÂ­lar open-source licenses that all require attriÂ­buÂ­tion of theÂ authorâs name and copyÂ­right, includÂ­ing the MIT license, the GPL, and the Apache license. (These are enuÂ­merÂ­ated in the appenÂ­dix to the comÂ­plaint.)In addiÂ­tion to vioÂ­latÂ­ing the attriÂ­buÂ­tion requireÂ­ments of these licenses, we conÂ­tendÂ that the defenÂ­dants have vioÂ­lated:GitHubâs own terms of serÂ­vice and priÂ­vacy poliÂ­cies;DMCA Â§Â 1202, which forÂ­bids the removal of copyÂ­right-manÂ­ageÂ­ment inforÂ­maÂ­tion;the CalÂ­iÂ­forÂ­nia ConÂ­sumer PriÂ­vacy Act;and other laws givÂ­ing rise to related legal claims.In the weeks ahead, we will likely amend this comÂ­plaint to add other parÂ­ties and claims.This is the first step in what will be a long jourÂ­ney. As far as we know, this is the first class-action case in the US chalÂ­lengÂ­ing the trainÂ­ing and outÂ­put of AI sysÂ­tems. It will not be the last. AI sysÂ­tems are not exempt from the law. Those who creÂ­ate and operÂ­ate these sysÂ­tems must remain accountÂ­able. If comÂ­paÂ­nies like Microsoft, GitHub, and OpenAI choose to disÂ­reÂ­gard the law, they should not expect that we the pubÂ­lic will sit still. AI needs to be fair & ethÂ­iÂ­cal for everyÂ­one. If itâs not, then it can never achieve its vaunted aims of eleÂ­vatÂ­ing humanÂ­ity. It will just become another way for the privÂ­iÂ­leged few to profit from the work of the many.We plan to update this webÂ­site regÂ­uÂ­larly durÂ­ing the litÂ­iÂ­gaÂ­tion.

The defenÂ­dants and claims are othÂ­erÂ­wise simÂ­iÂ­lar to the iniÂ­tial comÂ­plaint filed on NovemÂ­ber 3.Todayâs filÂ­ings:Class-action comÂ­plaintClass-action comÂ­plaint: AppenÂ­dix AClass-action comÂ­plaint: Exhibit 1ConÂ­tactÂ­ing usIf youâre a memÂ­ber of the press or the pubÂ­lic with other quesÂ­tions about this case or related topÂ­ics, conÂ­tact github_inquiries@saverÂ­iÂ­lawÂ­firm.com.
