Charlotte McGinn - Software engineer, founder, and travelerCharlotte McGinnHi! I'm Charlotte, a software engineer turned entrepreneur. Currently I'm the co-founder of Cashmere, a wallet for startups to securely store their crypto. I've always loved tinkering with software and electronics, and find myself most happy building reliable backend systems.Outside of work I love traveling the world, playing ultimate frisbee, playing videogames, and drawing, among many other things. I believe life is best spent having a large multitude of experiences so I design my life to be varied and interesting.
