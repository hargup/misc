CoCounsel is an outstanding product. It's like having an associate lawyer ready to take on an endless number of delegated tasks and deliver it all in minutes.

—Greg Siskind, Immigration Attorney and Founder, Siskind Susser PC







CoCounsel is shockingly good—it's a force multiplier. A lawyer with CoCounsel is more efficient, effective, and confident. That’s a lawyer who's more willing and able to step out and help more people.

—Joe Gibson, Managing Attorney, Employment Law Center of Maryland







CoCounsel is like a legal research assistant in your pocket—or a co-counsel. Available and ready to assist in any way. The time-saving possibility here really is hard to overemphasize.

—Ariella Kupetz, Associate, Fisher Phillips







The feedback I’ve received so far from people using CoCounsel has been phenomenal. It's fantastic. It blew their minds.

—Evan Shenkman, Chief Knowledge & Innovation Officer, Fisher Phillips







We have about 600 cases going back 1–3 years, waiting to be qualified. CoCounsel will let us cut that list in half. The sooner we qualify someone’s case, the sooner we can help them get or stay out of prison.

—Michael Semanchik, Managing Attorney, The California Innocence Project
