I'm researching ways to give people more agency in computing, so they can tweak or create their own tools, even if they don't have programming skills.
I'm currently a CS PhD student at MIT, in the Software Design Group. I also regularly work with the industrial research lab Ink & Switch. Previously, I helped build the edtech startup Panorama Education (YC S13).
These days, I'm thinking a lot about:
AI + malleable software: How can LLMs help people make custom software?

ðŸ“œ essay: Malleable software in the age of LLMs
ðŸŽ¥ talk/demo: Dynamic documents as personal software

Reactive UI: how can we make UI dev feel more like a spreadsheet?

ðŸ“œ essay: Building data-centric apps with a reactive relational database

If you'd like to hear about my future work, you can subscribe to occasional email updates. I'm also active on Twitter and Mastodon and have an RSS feed.
