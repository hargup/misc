Photo to copycat









					Upload a photo to copycat				




					Auto detect prompt
				




Photo strength


Maximum (only the photo) (0.95)
Strong (more similar to photo) (0.7)
Medium (0.45)
Light (more model/prompt resemblance) (0.3)
Featherlight (most model/prompt resemblance) (0.01)



				Photo strength (aka denoising strength) sets how strong the AI follows the photo you copycat. High amounts makes your generated photos closer to the photo you copycat. Low amounts of photo strength will use the photo more like inspiration and follow it less.
			

What to copycat

Photo + depth
Depth
Sketch
Photo
Body pose
Body pose + photo
Prompt
Reference (e.g. clothes)
Line pose (from Poses tab)



				You can choose what you'd like to copycat from the photo. Depth means it makes a 3d depth map of your photo and tries to follow that, but the photo itself can change. Reference uses it more like an inspiration. Body pose lets you copy a pose from a photo, while line pose lets you select a pose from the Poses tab your AI character will follow. Body pose + photo copies the pose and also the photo.
			

Prompt
model in silk if(gender=f){dress} if(gender=m){suit} in luxury villa with glass windows at sunset


			The longer your prompt is the less resemblance to your AI character it has, so keep prompts short and simple.
		

Negative prompt / Remove from photo



			The more you negatively prompt, the more resemblance you lose.

Upscale strength


Disable upscaler

Extreme (cfg=19)
Strong (cfg=12)
Medium (cfg=7.5)
Regular (cfg=6)
Light (cfg=3) (default)
Featherlight (cfg=1)



				Higher upscale strength (aka upscale guidance scale) gives your photos more details. Too high and you get deformed bodies, too low and skin will be too smooth. Switching upscaler off will get you the raw output which might be better for artistic photos with high resemblance.
			

Prompt strength


Extreme (cfg=19)
Strong (cfg=12)
Normal (cfg=7.5) (default)
Medium (cfg=6)
Light (cfg=3)



				Higher prompt strength (aka guidance scale) will take photos closer to your prompt.

						Create your own AI character
					

						 Create photography with artificial intelligence by training your own AI character. Upload a set of just 30 photos in a diverse range of places, settings, times, and attire. By inputting these images into your AI character, you're teaching it to recognize and replicate it.

						 You only need to train your AI character once which takes about 28 minutes.
					










						Design photorealistic scenes
					

						Design any scene you wish, from commonplace to rare, stunning instances. Imagine the ability to create a photograph of a sunlit Parisian cafe in the 1920s, or a moonlit beach in Bali with just the right clothes, all from the comfort of your living room. 

						Simply describe your desired scene and watch as the model generates a highly realistic photo that aligns with your vision. Taking photos is fast: right now it takes about 554 seconds per photo.
					










						Try on clothes
					

						Take any clothes you like from the web and import them into Photo AI and try on different clothes and styles on your AI model.
					










						Magic Editor
					

						Use Photo AI's Magic Editor to select things from your generated photos you don't like, write how you'd like to change them, and it will change it according to your wishes. Also great to brush out typical AI artefacts and anomalies.
