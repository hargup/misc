Thank you for becoming Orion patron.

Bring your favorite extensions.


                    Orion offers native support for many Firefox and Chrome browser
                    extensions allowing access to the world's largest
                    eco-system of browser extnesions.                    

                    We're still in the process of expanding our extension support to include all available options. Simultaneously, we're working on bringing this feature to iOS
                    and Orion is the first browser that allows you to
                    install
                    select web extensions directly from the Chrome Web Store or Firefox
                    Add-Ons on your iPhone or iPad.

Privacy by design, like no other browser.
Orion has been engineered from ground up as a truly
                        privacy-respecting browser. We did it by embracing a simple principle - Orion is a zero telemetry browser. Your private information will never leave Orion by default.

                        And to protect your privacy on the web, Orion comes with industry-leading anti-tracking technology as well as a powerful built-in ad-blocker.

FeaturesBecome Orion Supporter F.A.Q.





                1. Orion is currently available for Apple macOS, iPadOS and iOS. We are planning support for other platforms in the future.

                2. We have ported the Web Extensions API to WebKit, allowing
                Orion to run Chrome and Firefox extensions out of the box.
                This support is still experimental while we are in beta and
                some extensions may not work properly.
            

                3. Live Text is a macOS feature allowing to interact with a text in the photo, currently supported in multiple languages.
