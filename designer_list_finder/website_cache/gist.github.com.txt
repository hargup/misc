# I happened to be looking at some of Cranelift's code, and I noticed that their constant-time dominates()



# check was using a somewhat more ad-hoc version of a hidden gem from the data structures literature called the



# parenthesis representation for trees. As far as I know, this was invented by Jacobson in his 1989 paper



# Space-Efficient Static Trees and Graphs. I first learned about it from the slightly later paper by Munro and Raman



# called Succinct Representations of Balanced Parentheses and Static Trees. I figured I'd give it an extremely



# quick intro and then show how it leads to a (slightly better) version of Cranelift's algorithm.



#



# This parenthesis representation of trees is surprisingly versatile, but its most striking feature is that



# it lets us query the ancestor relationship between two nodes in a tree in constant time, with a few instructions.



# And the idea is extremely simple and intuitive if you just draw the right kind of picture.

// This can grow a Robin Hood linear probing hash table near word-at-a-time memcpy speeds. If you're confused why I use 'keys'



// to describe the hash values, it's because my favorite perspective on Robin Hood (which I learned from Paul Khuong)



// is that it's just a sorted gap array which is MSB bucketed and insertion sorted per chain:



// https://pvk.ca/Blog/2019/09/29/a-couple-of-probabilistic-worst-case-bounds-for-robin-hood-linear-probing/



// The more widely known "max displacement" picture of Robin Hood hashing also has strengths since the max displacement



// can be stored very compactly. You can see a micro-optimized example of that here for small tables where the max displacement



// can fit in 4 bits: Sub-nanosecond Searches Using Vector Instructions, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paxIkKBzqBU



void grow(Table *table) {



 u64 exp = 64 - table->shift;



 // We grow the table downward in place by a factor of 2 (not counting the overflow area at table->end).
