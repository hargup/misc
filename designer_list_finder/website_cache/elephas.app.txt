Truly transformed the way I work

"As an  Entrepreneur and product manager, I can say with confidence that Elephas is the single most powerful productivity tool I've ever added to my Mac. It has become an integral part of my workflow, from ideation to execution. This is literally having the power of GPT-3 baked into your OS. This is what Siri can only dream to be. 
                            
                              Elephas has helped me to streamline my research process. I can ask it any question, and it will quickly find the answer for me. This is a huge time-saver, as I no longer have to type out my ideas.
                              
                              Second, Elephas has helped me to improve the quality of my writing. I can ask it to proofread my work for me, and it will point out any errors or areas that need improvement. This has helped me to produce better-quality writing, and has saved me a lot of time in the editing process.

                              
                              Overall, I highly recommend Elephas to anyone who is looking to increase their productivity. It has truly transformed the way I work, and has made me more efficient and effective in everything I do."

What our customers say about us

















See how Elephas is helping Andrew accelerate his writing





























I've tested dozens of AI-based content editing tools, and Elephas is in a class by itself. The features are great, and the developer is very responsive. I use it every day!





Rodrigo Franco
rodrigofranco.com

























I LOVE this tool. As an analyst at a VC firm and a podcast host who has to market his own material. I've been very curious about how AI can help me get more done in less time. Other tools like Jasper and LEX are great at what they do. Elephas is one tool in my arsenal I am so thankful I have. Its great that it sits on your Mac, ready to be used inside any apps.





Jacob Brown
Analyst

























I like that I can use my own OpenAI API key to bring GPT-3 to any app on my Mac.





Josh Mulliken
Security Architect at RedHat

























As a professional writer whose native language isn't English, I started using Elephas as a "live assistant" to quickly fix grammar in complex sentences or change the tone of some part of my texts.





Thomas Segura
Technical Content Writer

























Hey all! I'm a web developer and have been struggling to write content in my clients' voice. Using Elephas, I was able to create a "profile" of my client, ask the AI questions, and finish up my work quickly. 100% Would recommend!





Alex Bootthanoo
Web Designer

























I love Elephas. I use it daily. The price is great, and even though I use it every day my OpenAI costs haven't gone above $10/mo yet. I hit $9 last month, but that took a LOT of work.
