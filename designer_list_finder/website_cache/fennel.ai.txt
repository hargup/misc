Realtime Feature Store for Machine Learning | FennelFennelCompanyBlogDocumentationRequest a demoRealtime Feature Platform. Beautifully Built.Fennel helps you author, compute, store, serve, monitor & govern both realtime and batch ML features.Read the DocumentationIncredibly easy to install & useShip Features 100x Faster.  Yes, 100x!Real Python. No DSLs.No DSL, no Spark or Flink jobs. Plain old Python & Pandas means zero learning curve for you.Automatic BackfillsPipelines backfill automatically on declaration - no more pesky one off scripts.Fully-Managed InfrastructureFennel brings up & manages everything that is needed - zero dependencies on your prod infra.Feature repository for reuseWrite standardized features once, share & reuse across all your use cases.Best-in-class data quality toolingNo more feature or data bugsStrong TypingCatch typing bugs at compile time and at source of data, thanks to strong typing.Immutability & VersioningImmutable & versioned features to eliminate offline online skew due to definition changes.Unit TestingPrevent unforced errors by writing unit tests across batch & realtime pipelines.Compile Time ValidationStrict end to end lineage validation at compile time to prevent runtime errors.Data ExpectationSpecify expected data distributions, get alerted when things go wrong.Online / Offline SkewSingle definition of feature across both offline and online scenarios.Data Quality with FennelPowerful & FlexibleInsanely Realtime.  Exact same code as batch.After all, batch is just a special case of stream processing. Why not future proof your ML stack if realtime came for free?Kappa Pipeline ArchitectureUnprecedented PowerTemporally correct streaming joinsNo more stale dataSub-second Feature FreshnessSingle-digit ms responseUltra-low Latency ServingEnterprise-Grade PerformanceHassle-free ScalingScalability & ReliabilityScale to billions of feature queries without lifting a finger.Learn MoreEnterprise-grade SecuritySOC2-compliant deployment inside your VPC.Learn MoreCloud Cost EfficiencyLower cloud cost for the same workload & performance.Learn MoreHow it worksRead & Write Path SeparationThe right abstraction for realtime feature engineeringBring your DataUse built-in connectors to effortlessly bring all your data to Fennel.Derive Data via Streaming PipelinesDefine FeaturesQuery via the REST APIShow CodeCraftsman-like passion for Developer ExperienceArchitected with LoveExplore the ArchitectureRustThe primary language of our backend, relying heavily on Tokio's async runtimeKafkaHandles all inflow data.
