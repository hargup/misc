I tried out bloop because it sounded interesting, but I found it extremely valuable, even more than I expected.JFJim FungHonestly, it's exactly what I've been looking for, the way you've put Bloop together works pretty damn well.MVMark VasilkovHi, I think bloop is actually amazing, I'll be demoing it to my team :)OMOmar MagdyIt's a neat product and definitely a productive way to navigate new reposLGLucas GreenwellAbsolutely loved the conversational interface with direct knowledge of my codeDPDavid PriddleWell, GPT is an amazing thing. It's really nice to be able to incorporate it with my code. Bloop was great for getting up on a gnarly golang codebase I wasn't familiar withCVChirag VegedIts been a great experience to using bloop!SSSean SmithFirst off, the app is really well built. Bloop fits the gap between GPT4 and Copilot very well.ASAleixo SanchezJust wanted to quickly say thank you, it's awesome.BMBraxton MillsIt’s going great! This is exactly what I was looking for.HNHilton NguyenI just want to say thank you for the creation of Bloop. I use it for code indexing and to simply ask questions about the codebase from a broader holistic viewpoint, etc. Despite being in its early stages, it's proving to be a valuable tool.AAergoTo be honest, I'm quite excited about Bloop and its potential. I appreciate that it is a standalone product and does not need to be integrated with an IDE like VSCode or JetBrains to function effectively. Additionally, I find the desktop version's ability to access the file system and analyze local repositories very useful.GAGabriel AlmeidaAs soon as I opened it I saw its potential as an onboarding tool. Understanding code you don't know much about quickly is very useful.WTWeiZhi TangBloop is cool and helpful especially when reading source code.FYFande YuI wanted to take a moment to express my appreciation for the power and helpfulness of Bloop. I have found it incredibly useful in explaining codes committed by others, completing functions, and writing unit tests.SSSamir SinghI'm enjoying bloop. Being able to ask questions of a repository's code in bloop has been really helpful and I love the bloop interface. I feel like the same interface and workflows could actually be applied to so many verticals. Thanks so much for the work you guys are doing.MNMarco NevesBloop is great. I stumbled upon it while coincidentally developing the same concept and was blown at way at how polished the system is. Great job!JNJoao Deher NetoCongratulations for the great job, bloop is quite fun!BSBrian SimpsonI am really loving your product so far. I used it to refactor my resume codes folder because it enabled me to easily create a README for my older code that I had forgotten the finer details of. Thanks again for creating such a useful and innovative tool.YYianBloop works really well for me, I'm really surprised by how much it actually could help me with my coding.BSBen ShewmakerI love, love being able to ask high level questions and getting pointed to the right point in the code. Keep up the good work, and best of luck with Bloop!MSMassimo SavinoSuch a great tool! Liking the look, style, and overall responsiveness of the app, especially WRT syncing quickly and effortlesslyZCZhenyu ChenI was trying to understand an unpopular codebase, and I felt lost. Then I saw someone shared this tool on Twitter. It's just so amazing when I tried it out. It literally tells me the logic of the whole codebase.AAlistairThe app is cool and I was able to successfully search for some code using natural language which I was really impressed by.Load moreCode DiscoveryNatural language search surfaces internal libraries and existing patterns. 
        This helps prevent stale code, dependency bloat and frees up time to work on unsolved problems.Hamel HusainFormer GitHub Code Search LeadMaking it easier to discover internal APIs improves adoption and reduces
        duplication. bloop’s natural language search returns accurate results in
        less time, making it a powerful alternative to slow keyword searches and
        asking colleagues for help.Human Explanationbloop understands your codebase. When responding to natural language searches, 
        complex concepts are summarised and the intention behind code is explained.Igor SusmeljCofounder, LightlyUnderstanding code is a major component of every developer’s day. bloop’s summarization 
          helps close the development loop by speeding up code review, planning and many other tasks.Stage ChangesYou can follow up a natural language search with a codebase change.
