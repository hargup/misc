Project Shenava

Tech has been my passion since childhood. I see Coding as a superpower that can help solve problems around the world. I have been coding since a very young age and have been spending most of my weekends attending an hackathon. Project Shenava is a place where one can find my projects and startups. Project Shenava will have projects for every Tech be it AI, Blockchain, VR, IoT and more. Apart from my projects and startups, Project Shenava is also open to collaboration as well.
