We like to think of it as behind-the-scenes magic that makes the carting process as simple and seamless as possible. The friction-free, one-click path to purchase means consumers aren’t distracted by competitor ads or cross-selling, and there is no waiting (i.e. forgetting) to check out. And even when shoppers don’t complete a purchase, you still win because carting triggers retargeting (building brand awareness) and improves retailer-side SEO/SEM results.Smart solutions that boost your bottom lineOur suite of solutions fits any campaign objective and comes with a convenient to use 24/7 platform and next-level client support!
