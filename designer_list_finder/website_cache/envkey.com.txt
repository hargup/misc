      Uncompromising security.
    



Zero-knowledge end-to-end encryption with out-of-band verification ensures that no host, server, employee, or third party (including EnvKey) ever has access to your organization's secrets, unless it is specifically granted. 
    

      EnvKey protects secrets from insider threats, ex-employees, data breaches, browser extensions, third party services, and server compromise.
    


        Security Overview
      







      Reliable and redundant.
    



      For EnvKey Cloud and Business Self-Hosted, redundancy across availability zones and regions allows us to guarantee >99.99% uptime for loading secrets and config.
  






          EnvKey has eliminated a class of problem which absolutely plagued us, especially on new fast-moving projects, where you can't afford to lose half a day debugging some cryptic error message because there just happens to be a random new env var.

          EnvKey has been such a lifesaver for our team at Soundstripe. Onboarding new developers was instantly streamlined as far as environment setups are concerned, and configuring servers has been simplified dramatically. We're hooked!

          First of all, I would like to say THANK YOU. EnvKey has solved a major problem for us, in managing our secrets really well. We rolled it out across our dev, staging and production environments yesterday, and it was a smooth, 15 minute process.
