Morning Docket: 09.13.23 


* Sam Bankman-Fried denied pre-trial release after arguing that his alleged witness tampering, not unlike the value of cryptocurrency, wasn't what it looked like on paper. [Reuters]
* After opening door a crack to allow some transparency in proceedings during the pandemic, the federal courts look to curtail live audio access. [Law360]
* Lawyer informs Texas Senate that Ken Paxton approved every bit of investigation at heart of impeachment. [Texas Tribune]
* Trial to begin to decide constitutionality of "America's most extreme gun control law." The law just requires gun owners to get a permit and bans magazines over 10 rounds. Again, this is what passes for the "most extreme" law in the country. [Fox News]
* Gibson Dunn alters diversity scholarship criteria as activists ramp up threats to sue law firms for pursuing initiatives to make the profession less white. [Bloomberg Law News]
* Meanwhile, two law schools are back in compliance with ABA accreditors after improving faculty diversity and likely putting them out of compliance with these litigious activists (Another law school is back in compliance after improving its finances... which is less controversial). [Law.com]
* Governor asks to change state's public records law to keep her travel under wraps. [ABC]
