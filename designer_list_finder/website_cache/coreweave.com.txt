Not just for the individual artists, but also for rendering on the queue as well. If we need to provision hundreds of GPUâs for a long sequence, we are able to do that quickly and easily â and thatâs been awesome.âRajesh Sharma, VP of Engineering at Spire Animation StudiosRead case study ââCoreWeave is a valued, dedicated partner of NVIDIA. As such, they were named our first Elite Cloud Solutions Provider for Compute in the NVIDIA Partner Network. By offering their clients a tremendously broad range of compute options - from A100s to A40s - at unprecedented scale and their commitment to delivering world-class results in AI, machine learning, visual effects and more. NVIDIA is a proud supporter of CoreWeave.âMatt McGrigg, Global Director Business Development, Cloud & Strategic Partners, NVIDIARead case study ââAlways having access to GPUs on-demand has been a huge sanity saver. The availability and reliability of CoreWeaveâs service allowed us to serve our current models and continuously build and test new ideas.âYasu Seno, CEO, Bit192, Inc.Read case study ââAfter a few months of struggling to keep up with demand at mega-cloud prices, we were able to seamlessly move our cloud infrastructure over to CoreWeave. Using CoreWeaveâs Inference Optimized V100 instances, our inference latencies dropped by 50% and the cost savings from our partnership allowed us to continue delivering our free-tier experience and substantially reduce our cost-per-user.âNick Walton, Founder & CEO of Latitude, the creator of AI DungeonRead case study ââBy pairing the NVIDIA Quadro RTX and RTX A6000 GPUs with PCoIP technology from Teradici, artists get access to ultra-low latency, high powered GPU-accelerated Virtual Workstations that allow them to work at âhuman-speed.â Now, we can tackle projects that in the past, our hardware could have never handled, and our team can truly showcase their talents without being held back by tech restraints.â Andrew Bly, CEO at Molecule VFXRead case study ââCoreWeaveâs deployment architecture enables us to scale up extremely fast when there is more demand. We are able to serve requests 3x faster after migrating to CoreWeave, leading to a much better user experience while saving 75% in cloud costs. For the users, this means the generation speeds will never slow down, even when there is peak load.âEren DoÄan, CEO, NovelAIRead case study ââWith my previous platform, I couldn't choose the hardware â I was locked into a Tesla K80. With CoreWeave, Iâm less worried about the service scaling up if we do a big marketing campaign or get mentioned by a big influencer, which has given me a lot of confidence and means we can think bigger.âAngus Russell, Founder, NightCafeRead case study ââCoreWeave is an anchor provider of compute infrastructure for our transcoding network. The ability to Right-Size our workloads across CoreWeaveâs diverse infrastructure set allows us to substantially reduce our compute costs and pass those savings along to our clients.âDoug Petkanics, CEO, LivepeerIn the NewsA Startup in the New Jersey Suburbs Is Battling the Giants of Silicon ValleyA Startup in the New Jersey Suburbs Is Battling the Giants of Silicon ValleyAugust 25, 2023How Nvidia Built a Competitive Moat Around A.I.
