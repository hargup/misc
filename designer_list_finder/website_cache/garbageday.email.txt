If I had to describe this newsletter in six words it would be "body horror, but for the internet."”Casey Newton, Platformer“Ryan makes the only useful predictions about the internet, by watching what actual people are actually doing.”Nick  Catucci, Embedded“Really and truly helps me understand the weirdest and most complicated shit on the internet. ”Anne Helen Petersen, Culture StudyBy registering you agree to Substack's Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, and our Information Collection Notice© 2023 Ryan BroderickPrivacy ∙ Terms ∙ Collection notice Start WritingGet the appSubstack is the home for great writing
