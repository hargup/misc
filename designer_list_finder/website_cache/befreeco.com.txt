Lightweight Activewear for Everywhere You Go












Dress with Less StresszipOns are a stylish and functional solution for those with limited mobility, offering a new level of ease and comfort to those who wear them and their caregivers.

Our patented design makes dressing and undressing safer, easier and more comfortable. zipOns open and unzip completely on both sides of the legs with zippers spanning waist to hem. They can be put on and taken off easily while standing, lying down, or from a sitting position without  pulling up through the legs like traditional pants. zipOns open from the bottom as needed to accommodate casts, braces and other medical equipment, making them ideal for post surgery and injury recovery.

Testimonials





Kathy, Kentucky"Paxton, who’s 5, loves that he can unzip the pants himself and that they easily go over his AFOs. I love that is makes diaper changes easier! They also hold up well in the wash. Overall a functional and durable product!"







Mark, Louisiana"I love the flexibility these pants give me especially if I need to take my pants off in my wheelchair. Amazing inclusive design."







Jadie, Arizona"I love the comfort and ease that ZipOns provide! My son has had many orthopedic procedures done on his legs over the years and these are our go-to pants. They are warm, comfortable, and my son absolutely loves them!"







KC, Massachusetts"zipOns were a game changer for me. I am a 51 year old active female and unfortunately I have had two hip replacements. The first hip was replaced and I was not not fortunate enough to know about befree pants - I was completely dependent on my husband. I had the second hip replaced a year later, however this time I had zipOns. The pants were truly a game changer, I was so much more independent which totally helped in my rehabilitation. I think zipOns are AWESOME!"







Katrena, Illinois"These pants are AMAZING! Natalie actually stole them from Avery since she can’t stand without her AFOs on! She loves the zippers on each side, the lightweight and breathability, and the comfort! Highly recommend these pants to anybody that needs side zippers all the way up each leg!"







Mary, Massachusetts"I love these pants so much, they are so comfortable and make dressing easy. I want them in all different colors!"







Siobhan, Massachusetts"zipOns were amazing after my daughter’s foot surgery. They made the many hospital and doctor visits so much easier without having to undress every time. And they fit great over her cast. Highly recommend!"
