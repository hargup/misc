Aman@_amankishore @brevdev x @BananaDev_ is too OP of a setup 😍 Daniel Whitenack@dwhitena I had a delightful time setting up a #GPU-based dev environment... When's the last time you said that? 😀 John Simerlink@johnsimerlink @brevdev I just had the best developer experience and customer service I may have had with any product ever. I had spent hours trying to rent GPUs and configuring environments correctly. I stumbled across brev and 10 minutes later had it running and working locally Rony@ronyfadel The auto-stop feature alone has saved me a fortune. Aman@_amankishore Been using @brevdev for 5 min today and I’m sold! Brev makes it ridiculously easy to spin up spot instances for development (60% cheaper than on-demand), excited to save a lot more on dev costs this month! Mitesh@mitesh711 @brevdev's offering is very smooth. Don't have to care about underlying GPU/cloud at all. Rony@ronyfadel Brev saved me so much time developing and deploying ML apps, compared to running jobs locally. With Brev, I don’t have to go through clunky AWS or GCP UI’s, spend an hour setting up an instance just to realize that GPU’s are not available in that region.  Jasper@Jasperschoormns Really recommend @brevdev for GPU programing. Your own powerful GPU server, but its cheap and so easy to set up. Couldn't do it locallyOfficial PartnersTrusted By Engineers FromRadically Better GPUsSimple GPUsUse Brev.dev to find a GPU and get it configured to fine-tune or train your model. Get a GPU (or CPU).A single interface between AWS, GCP, and Lambda GPU cloud. Use credits when you have them. Pick an instance based on costs & availability.Setup Software.CUDA just works. Dependencies installed properly. No more python environment issues. Networking too. A CLI to automatically update your SSH config ensuring it's done securely.

Brev connects to cloud providers to find you a GPU at the best price, configures it, and wraps SSH to connect your code editor to the remote machine. Quick startQuick StartMake a Brev account and your first instance.ReferenceReference for higher level concepts, the CLI, instance types, etc.Infrastructure How TosChange your instance, add or remove a GPU, add GB to your hard drive, etc.Environment How TosSet up your environment to make sure your code always runs. Make it easy to share or clone.Quick start1. Create an accountMake an account in the Brev console.2. Create your first instanceYou can create your own instance from scratch or use a template. The console should give you a couple of template options.For example, click here to create an instance with the Stable Diffusion template.3. Connect to your instance and start codingBrev wraps ssh to make it easy to hop into your instance, so with the CLI, run one of the following commands in your terminal.To SSH your terminal into your dev instance:brev shell stable-diffusion
or SSH VS Code into your instance with:brev open stable-diffusion # ssh with vscode into your instance
That's it 🎉Try creating your own instance here and reach out to us in the Discord for help! We're here for anything you need. Build something great. 🤙Running instance might still be installing your dependenciesIf the instace is running, that means it is available. If you have a lot of software dependencies, they might still be installing, so just give it a moment.
