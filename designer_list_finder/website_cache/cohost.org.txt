                                    but no oneâs managed to create one without profound
                                    flaws. weâre borrowing liberally from other sites,
                                    but we want to build cohost into something that
                                    works well and serves its users rather than
                                    just another clone.there is value in being in the same place as everyoneon a web without functioning search engines,
                                    blogs and friends-only sites may be okay for
                                    some, but they leave people who are scraping
                                    by on public visibility and word of mouth in
                                    the lurch.â¦but nobody wants a digital panopticonon modern social media, there is an ever-present
                                    fear that someone will see your post, have their
                                    own bad faith interpretation, and decide to ruin
                                    your day over it. platforms are often built to
                                    encourage this sort of behavior to drive up
                                    engagement, but they donât have to be.metrics are ruining our livesmodern social media is designed around a
                                    vicious feedback loop that keeps users Engaged
                                    at the expense of their mental health, all
                                    in order to make their executives more money.the value of social media is its postswe arenât the ones providing the most important

                                but weâre committed to getting it right and trying
