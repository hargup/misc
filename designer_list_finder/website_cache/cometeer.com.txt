Endorsed by Experts









              David Chang, Michelin Star Chef & Momofuku Founder
            

"I’ve always loved pour over coffee but didn’t have the time nor expertise needed to make it correctly, and I’ve always wanted to support the best coffee farmers and roasters but didn’t know where to start. Cometeer connects all of these dots, making great coffee more accessible for me."











              James Hoffman, World Barista Champion & Coffee YouTuber
            

"What made me so excited about Cometeer was that finally great coffee had no barriers of equipment, or skills. Drinking some of the very best coffee in the world is now incredibly easy."











              George Howell, Coffee Roaster
            

"I think that Cometeer will do for coffee what the bottle did for wine."

    It’s like a hole was punched in the space time continuum and these little capsules fell out. Space is a big place. It’s hard to say for sure, but it’s unlikely there’s coffee this delicious anywhere else. There's coffee before and there's coffee after. However you enjoy coffee, this is a better way to enjoy coffee. Science, art, strange machinery, and -321 degrees fahrenheit. The coffee-verse will never be the same.
