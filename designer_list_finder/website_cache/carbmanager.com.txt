                After nearly being separated from the US Navy due to my weight, I discovered Keto and lost 100 pounds. I switched to Carb Manager from another popular nutrition tracker. CM was MORE helpful in maintaining a Keto lifestyle.

                I dressed up as Spider Man for my sons 6th birthday and saw the pictures. That‚Äôs when I realized I needed to make a lifestyle change. Then I went Keto and will never go back. The Carb Manager app has been a life saver.

                I started this journey at 372.9 pounds and I was ready to change my life. Carb Manager allowed me to change my approach to food, and now I see my food as a bank with a limit that renews every 24 hours. It has become a game to try to stay under my carb limit every day.

               Before  After  
                Since my old clothes still fit I didn't think I had put on that much weight... Until I weighed myself again. I had put on over 40 lbs! Carb Manager has helped me lose this weight, and replaced 4 different apps to track my macros, measurements, water, and fasting. It‚Äôs an easy, one-stop app.

               Before  After  
                In January 2019 I learned I was a few months away from being diabetic. Carb Manager helps me see the hard numbers before I eat so I can make better decisions. Results from my most recent bloodwork have normal numbers and showed me I can do this and live a long and healthy life.

               Before  After  
                Short: We tried so many other ‚Äúdiets,‚Äù but none worked long-term. Now Keto has become a lifestyle. Without Carb Manager, we wouldn't have been as successful. The app makes it so easy to monitor your macros. Better than all the other tracker apps, by far.

                I lost 20kg in the first 6 months! I really liked how the app adjusted my macros and requirements as I lost weight, in addition to the motivation I received in the community area where there were people with the same goals as me! The premium recipes in the app are delicious, and always work out 10/10.

                I tried to carb count on my own, and didn't lose any weight. Then I found Carb Manager, and lost a significant amount of weight right away. When I hit a plateau, I tried CM Premium for a month and the premade meal plans helped me lose another 10lbs that month so I signed up for a year!
