This is the best Twitter based chrome extension I have used. The insights of analytics you get on this are so helpful in building the right audience. The best feature is Most Engaging Hours, this gave me the perfect reach for my tweets. Great work Tony üëèüèº

This extension is incredibly helpful for building and growing an audience on Twitter. I've been using it for awhile and I absolutely loved it. The UI looks slick, clean and very informative. The best thing is I can see all the metrics, even within 24h period. All within the Twitter.com page.


If you're on Twitter and want to get the most of it, give this extension a try. You will not regret!

A little late in getting it but undoubtedly this is the best way to increase engagement and activity on Twitter. The Tweet Inspirations and Most engaging hours is a really helpful tool to increase activity on Profile. The profile stats (especially Consistency) is my personal favourite feature! Tony's Twitter Growth tools are indeed a boon to all! Excited to see what's next.

Love it! It's like a bunch of Twitter tools that you'd pay a ton of money for combined into one! The only thing missing now is scheduled tweets and I can cancel my subs for 3 other tools. Love the fact that you can now categorize tweets into bookmark folders and take notes on individual accounts. Pretty cool that you don't have to leave Twitter to see all of these things unlike other platforms. Can't wait to see what else is in store...

Black magic is amazing ‚Äì a must have product if you're serious about growing your Twitter audience. I can see how my tweets perform and know immediately which one deliver the best result!


The analytics is simple, yet insightful. I have tweets that have little impression, but huge comments + likes. Some with high impression doesn't even have any engagement.



You won't get this kind of information without processing your data before hand. 



Black magic shows it immediately.

It lifts Twitter on the next level for me. Makes it easy to have multiple conversations with my loyal followers, see when I should interact and gives a great overview. Honestly, I wonder why Twitter did not already have this.


I recommend everyone who takes Twitter a bit more seriously to use this extension.
