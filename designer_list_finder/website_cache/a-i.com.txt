Conversational AI, 
 



made accessible 



							Building award winning chatbots for world’s leading brands and entertainment franchises such as Disney, Hennesey, Lionsgate and others, has led us to identify key elements that will drive value for the field of conversational AI.
						







 











 







							We envisioned users creating natural, easy and  flowing conversational experiences, personalized and tailored to their needs. The process, end-to-end, is frictionless. No coding knowledge is required, all that’s needed is to write the conversation. Once.  
						



 



Cocohub is a no code bot building platform, allowing users to create humanlike conversational experiences on multiple communication channels, using the world’s largest library of pre-built components.  















 







Reusability  



							Create rich, deep conversational flows using the world’s largest library of pre-built cocos (conversational components). Cocos are conversational building blocks that cover a vast range of topics. Customize and connect them, to bring your brand’s voice to life.						











Easy to use 



							Simply write the conversation. Create your audience’s journey with your bot according to your brand’s tone and voice. The coding and machine learning abilities are on us.
