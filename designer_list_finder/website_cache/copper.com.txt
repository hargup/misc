Learn more about our take on CRM email integrations here.How does Copper integrate with Google Workspace?Copper is proud to be a Google Partner, a Recommended for Google Workspace app, and a Google-backed company. Our native Google Workspace integration is built around ease of use for our customers. Behind the scenes, Copper integrates with Gmail, Google Contacts, Google Drive and Google Calendar to sync the emails, files and calendar invites sent between your customers/prospects and team.
