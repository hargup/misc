Rough Notes
Writing rough notes allows me share more content, since polishing takes lots of time.
                            While I hope it's useful,
                            it's
                            likely lower quality and less carefully considered than my usual articles.

Research Taste Exercises
                                Five exercises for building
                                research taste (and three failure modes).
Interpretability vs Neuroscience
                                Six major
                                advantages which
                                make artificial neural networks easier to study than biological ones.
Analogies between Biology and Deep Learning
                                        Unusual analogies between biology and deep learning research.




Personal Writing

Micromarriages
                                A unit for romantic success (mostly humor).
Collaboration & Credit Principles
                                How can we be good stewards of collaborative trust?
Do I Need to Go to University?
                                Instead of asking “Is university good?”, ask “Do I have something more compelling to do?”
Notes on Habbema et al. (2015): "Realizing a Desired Family"


Matchmaking Party
                                A small amount of time matchmaking might be life changing for our friends. 
Dating Info
                                Normal online dating seems pretty suboptimal, so I just wrote a public dating profile.




Selected Twitter Threads
Sometimes I write twitter threads as a low-effort way to express something I'd have
                                    written an essay about if I
                                    had more time.

On Wanting Kids
                                        I really deeply want to have kids, to an extent I rarely see men talk about.
The Elegance of ML is the Elegance of
                                            Biology
                                        One of the main aesthetics driving my research.
The Wonders of Atmospheric
                                            Dynamics
                                        Like bio/chem/physics, meteorology has beautiful simple theories.
Research Intimacy
                                        Deeply internalizing knowledge and ways of thinking related to a research topic.

Why is fantasy so emotionally compelling
                                            to many of us?
                                        Magic as a metaphor for the humane and intimate aspects missing in technology.
Reflections on Gilead
                                        Thoughts on one of my favorite novels. Kindness, loneliness, and blessing.
Winter in San Francisco
                                        San Francisco has seasons. The winter is breathtakingly beautiful.
Integrity and Relationships Based on Values vs
                                            Beliefs
                                        Can we reconcile wanting to make those close to us proud with moral independence?
Against Polarization in the “Do Neural Networks
                                            Understand” Debate
                                        A lack of nuanced intermediate positions makes this conversation confusing.
