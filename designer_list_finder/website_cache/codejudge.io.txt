Within 2 months of launching the campaign, Codejudge helped us evaluate over 500 developers while streamlining all these candidates through their platform and skill proficiency data. We also closed these positions at a considerably lower hiring cost.âAbhishek ChatterjeeTechnical Recruitment Associate of UdaanâSkuad's mission is to serve high quality talent across different countries. It was essential for us to have a high quality talent pool from different job roles across various levels of experience. We had to find talent which could start delivering on Day 1. Codejudge not only enabled us to filter and find high quality developers, but also enabled us to vet over 5000 candidates in just 90 days. Whereas, a quarter before we could only assess about 800 candidates.âSundeep SahiCEO of SkuadâCodejudge was a game changer for us. My team and I were able to close 5 positions in just 3 weeks. Moreover, we filled all our roles across different experience levels through different types and levels of questions.âNamit NagiaVP of Engineering, HealofyâCodejudgeâs real-world assessments are interview grade and gave us the same data in 3 clicks which earlier took more than two interviews with our senior engineers.âNaman SinghalCTO of SkuadâFor an early stage startup like Flobiz, it was essential that we found the right engineering talent and that's where Codejudge aligned with our higher goals. Codejudge assessments gave us a chance to look beyond the "professionally tailored" resumes and assess the developers in real time while helping us reclaim the engineering hours lost to interviewing unqualified candidates.âRatikesh MVP of Engineering, FlobizâThe results were really impressive, and surpassed our expectations when we had started with the pilot. The Codejudge platform is really intuitive and has lots of features that eased out the load of us recruiters and it gave us a sense that if they could clear the Codejudge assessment they would definitely clear the final interview as well.âDhruv GuptaCo-founder of Orange HealthâWe've seen amazing results after using Codejudge. The whole assessment process and hiring experience is just so much better for our hiring managers and candidates..âRameshwar GuptaCTO of CarDekhoAssess better & hire faster with CodejudgeThis is some text inside of a div block.
