Support lifesaving research for people like Thalyta
Thalyta relies on a battery-powered device connected to her heart to keep her alive. But to survive for 10 years or more like this is almost unheard of - she needs a breakthrough. Help us turn science fiction into reality and help save lives like Thalyta's. Thank you ❤️
