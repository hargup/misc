Our customers like the look and feel of the forms and we have the flexibility and security to scale.”Josh N.Director, Education Administration“The power of #nocode is real! Airtable forms just got way better with Fillout. Make your forms stand out while making it easier for you to automate your work. 🤩 #nocode”Gareth PronovostAutomation Consultant“We've deployed Fillout to our teams in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Thailand with great success. It's proven to be more reliable than other tools, especially in remote areas.”Jason H.CEO, Biochar Life“I was looking for a somewhat advanced form tool to enroll my users on a registration platform in full integration with Airtable, with filters, conditional displays, pre-fills, url parameters with real-time data mapping from Airtable, error message customization, partial form submissions... I'm a bit demanding and I found all these features at Fillout, you can really develop a very very advanced tool and the customer service is responsive, efficient and nice! Thank you for all this and long life to Fillout!”Sébastien RadeDesigner, no-coder“If you want an actual form where people/yourself can add & edit records you should try fillout.com. I’ve been using it for a bit and it’s great.”Jack Simons@hoibouncer“Better customer support than my favorite restaurant in Nogales, Mexico.”Derrick D.Founder, Home Health“It's exactly what I was looking for. I built a multi-page form for my business in no time.”Arionna R.Founder, Syfted“Honestly I've used NotionForms, Tally, and Fillout. Fillout is bar the best in customiation, avalibility, flexibility, and, now, support.”GabeAvatar generation“Fillout as un super outil et une très bonne équipe, bon week-end from France !”Benjamin MartinGérant & co-fondateur“One of my best finds in the Airtable community was a recommendation for fillout.com. Development/support team is super responsive to bug fixes and have created or accelerated some new features I was seeking. I particularly like the show/hide logic…seems way easier than JotForm. I'm probably only a month or two from dropping JF completely in favor of Fillout. 🙂”Mark D Bowers@mark-bowers“Fillout c'est devenu mon chouchou dés la première utilisation. Je l'utilise partout maintenant.
        En effet sur le champ multiple choices, tu as une option other mais pas sur le select. Le service client est ultra réactif, ca vaut le coup de le remonter.”Arthur Juin@arthur-juin“Great product. Way better AND more affordable than Typeform.”Jake@jakenocode“Wow, just took this for a test drive and it's really good! Love the ability to update content in Airtable.”Mike W.Owner, Bureau Plus“Really Impressed by @filloutcom. If you are using #Airtable and feeling restricted or disappointed with the forms, check them out!”Jason@zensiblesol“Fillout UX is very smooth, support blazing fast, record picker and preview, webhook and conditional logic are available. I can only recommend to try it out!”RicardoApp Architect“I just launched our new quote form using Fillout w/ airtable - the product is terrific and by far the best solution for us out of all the other forms I've tried (typeform, jotform, etc.). I'm really thrilled about how much this will help our processes.”Daniel Magorrian@danielmagorrian“I really enjoy using Fillout, especially its integration with Notion. I really appreciate that I can use the file upload feature in the free tier. Excited to use more of Fillout in the future.”Dimas Almuhtada@dimas-sudjito“After trialling various form builders for Airtable, I came across Fillout and haven't looked back. The integration with Airtable is seamless, the pricing is incredibly reasonable, the user interface is incredible and last but far from least - the customer service is exceptional. I've had a few questions along the way and they've all been answered, via the chat box on their site, in a matter of minutes.”Michael U.Trustpilot“Airtable + Fillout + Softr is pretty banging combo for most SMB MVP's”Blue Oceans YachtingOwner“I can't believe I haven't come across Fillout till this past week. They're solving a real need in the no-code space and doing things that other form tools just aren't doing.”Reality ChurchOperations lead“Just want to say that I've been playing around for about an hour now and the level of sensible functionality Fillout offers is absolutely amazing. (Filtering on Airtable linked record field value, (which AT doesn't even offer themselves), creating records in a linked table, linking different forms to create multiple records in one table, etc.) Great job to the whole team over there, this is fantastic!”Erik ZijdemansCOO @ Publicize“We're using a combination of Fillout -> Airtable -> Glideapp and it's been an absolute gamechanger for our non-profit organisation.”Steffen Gray@steffengray“So far, amazing! I used this for both Airtable and Notion and I'm blown away by the customization capability for even the FREE version.”Brie Abes@brie_abes1“The best Notion integration with forms I have ever seen”PereTechnology Headhunter“I'm really getting to like Fillout... easy and clean interface and advanced feature set. What's also really nice is the ability to generate a unique link for each Airtable record that will allow editing only that individual record without access to the entire Base.”Donald MitchellTechnical Support“I'm obsessed. I'm sad I didn't find it earlier. I'll be moving forms over and recommending it to my clients. Well done on a fantastic product.”Ben MurrayTech consultant“In love with your product!! I have been looking for this solution for airtable for 3 years.”Sophie FaderCo-founder @spurjewelry“I already shared my positive opinion about Fillout but I reaffirm they're doing a really good job, truely a saviour tool.”Clement CœugnietGraphic Designer“Fillout est à ce jour pour moi le meilleur form builder si vous utilisez déjà Airtable ou Notion. Le marché des apps NoCode évolue et cet outil sera en Top 1 pour les recommandations auprès de mes clients.”Lilian SevoumianMake and Airtable expert“L’éditeur de logique conditionnelles, la fonctionnalité de remplissage de table liés, la facilité d’enchaînement de formulaires, design, login, webhook … j’adore.”Florian WoiselProduct Owner @ ChangeNOW“Actually just general kudos for a great product to Fillout. I tried Typeform, Jotform, Airtable forms, and Google form before trying it: Fillout has everything the competitors lack =)”SiggiBusiness Owner“I haven't been this enthusiastic about a tool since Airtable 5 years ago 😀”Celine DelvalNoCode Engineer“Just wanted to say how happy I am with Fillout at the moment. I'm using Fillout with Notion, it all works so flawlessly. Very impressed with the setup!”Dagmar MehlingNotion consultant“Been using the app for a few weeks... VERY impressed. Have not found anything I  want to do and can't - even on the free version. Customer support is always responsive and helpful. 👍”Dave Ferguson@daveferguson3660“OMG!!!!!  This is Godsend!  Fillout eliminated about 10 work arounds for me as well as solved issues we couldn't solve.   We are changing over today.  It's almost to good to be true.”Tommy Coe@tommycoe23333“Hace un tiempo armé mi primera encuesta con @filloutcom
 y me encantó poder armarlas al estilo "Elige tu propia aventura", según las opciones que elegías, las preguntas que veías 🤯”Maro Sola@marosola“Just started using @filloutcom and I'm already super excited about it. took me about three minutes to make a sign up form for my newsletter and hook up responses to post in a private Slack channel”Brittany Joiner@britt_joiner“Amazing. Definitely one of my favorite apps to use along with Airtable and Make.”Nate Sanden@nate_sanden“Where was @filloutcom when I was stringing together dependent drop-downs with Jotform/On2Air?! Will be switching over.”Saintly ActorSaintlyActor“I have been using Fillout forms for over 3 months and love the product. Their customer support is very very top.”Jonathan Pineda@acjnas“J’adore l’integrer aux portails que je construis avec Softr pour pouvoir facilement sélectionner un contact parmis ceux que j’ai dans Airtable, dans mon formulaire 😍

        Autre fonctionnalité super utile de Fillout : le champ « date range » pour sélectionner une plage de temps.”Elise Reichardt@elise-reichardtMake your first formin minutes.  For free.Unlimited forms with 1000 submissions/month.
