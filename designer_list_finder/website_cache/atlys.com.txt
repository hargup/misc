I gave him very short notice about my trip which I had less than 12 hours away from my flight boarding and with everything in tact and taken care of (Passport, COVID 19 test (PCR) Basic info) He was able to get my visa approved within less than 3 hours. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this app!!!Best service in the gameMay 5Rita ChaseyAtlas saved our trip. I made a mistake When submitting my trip information.

I got a phone call from atlys just after I submitted asking if I had any questions about the process, and it made me feel much more secure.A modern way to receive visas!1y agoMehmetThis app defins changed my attitude towards receiving various visas!!! It automatically booked all the needed flights, hotels, photos to pick up and even USPS stamps so I only needed to print and send all the needed documents via mail and wait for my visas to be stamped into my passport and sent back. Everything worked great and I am now returning back from my Eurpean trip which was under a high risk before I found the service! I want to also mention a fantastic support from Mohak! He was always ready to pick up my calls, answer all of my questions and genuinely cared about me getting the visa!Atlys is the BestMay 5SaraWow, i just got my passport, visa stamped and i am good to go.
