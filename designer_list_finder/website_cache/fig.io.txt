Cc: @figViljami Salminen@viljamisHow did I live without @fig for all these years? Such a great utility.Matthew Bloomfield@mattlovesjenniI started using @fig a few weeks ago and it's quickly become a tool that feels so native I couldn't go without - maybe the best CLI-enhancing tools out there. If you use the Terminal a lot I highly recommend it - it's as essential to the Terminal as Homebrew is to MacOS.Brian Lovin@brian_lovin@fig is fantastic ‚Äî it's one of those tools that feels so intuitive, and so obvious, that any terminal experience without it feels broken by comparison.gabrielstuff@gabrielstuffSo far I really enjoy my cli with @figEluert Mukja@mukja_e@fig Just downloaded Fig and oh man what a great extension for your terminal.
