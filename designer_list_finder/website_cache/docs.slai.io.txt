We started Slai to help developers build and deploy machine learning
applications on powerful cloud environments, without having to think about
infrastructure.
​Slai’s 3 core components
​Build in the Sandbox
The sandbox is a cloud-based IDE to build and manage your ML apps.

Write pre and post-processing logic in the handler
Write and run tests on your model
Connect datasets from an integration
Version your work as you iterate


​Deploy and Monitor
Applications are hosted on our serverless backend, with automatic scaling built-in.

Deploy a model to a serverless endpoint
Monitor inference time, traffic, and latency
Search through the Deployment Logs
Integrate the API into your app


​Share
Share your application with friends and colleagues. Slai makes your work fully reproducible - your end-to-end applications can be shared with anyone to customize and fork.

Publish your app and share it with your colleagues and friends
Fork a sandbox to customize and iterate on any model shared with you
Pin your model as a template for use in your organization
