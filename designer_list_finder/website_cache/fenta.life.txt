We have come up with this brilliant ad campaign called Fentalife. Sure, nobody understands it, we are graffitiing images illegally on buildings, and it’s just an attack on the poor, but look at our awesome design skilz! Key thing we want is less Narcan harm reduction and instead, far more police!Since we have loads of money (we are spending $300k on this campaign alone) it doesn't matter that we are putting up illegal graffiti. What is the City going to do? Is someone going to report all of these to 311.org? Fine us? So check out our beautiful ads post haste before some criminal defaces them: ​Larkin and Myrtle (320 Myrtle & 839 Larkin St)Larkin and Geary (915 Geary St)22nd and Mission (2632 Mission St)21st and Mission (2525 Mission St)9th Ave & Judah (420 Judah St)9th Ave & Clement (745 Clement St)Tehama & 9th street (235 9th St)7th and Stevenson (601 Stevenson St)19th and Ulloa (2508 19th Ave)6th and Mission (986 Mission St)20th and Mission (2385 Mission St)8th & Folsom (1212 Folsom St)
 

 

 













Core objective is for us to denigrate Narcan. Saving lives just means more addicts. And then we have to see those people living on the streets. Yuck! Just say no to harm reduction and yes to MORE POLICE!






People just love our ads. Well, not those people actually living in the TL. But this isn't about them. This is about Techbros embarrassing city hall with our beautiful graffiti. 




And what used to be on that wall on Myrtle St you ask??? It was some icky mural extolling the kids of the Tenderloin. But we, as techbros, are disrupting public art! That wall has been clearly now been put to better use by covering up the mural with our impressive graffiti. Save the children!





And 9th & Judah is an absolute Fentalife hotspot. The open-air drug markets are ruining the children there. So we graffitied our message there as well. Excellent neighborhood improvement!

 




Of course a prime reason for putting up these ads is to publicly thank our benefactor Michael Moritz. Without this billionares keen wisdom on dealing with economic inequality, housing, and addiction, this campaign would have never happened.





And we are paying lots of money to have this billboard roaming around the TL. Money for diesel, not for shelter!





Look at this great illegal graffiti we put up, right across from a children's playground on Myrtle St. Great opportunity for kids to learn that they are being used as pawns!





In case the City is upset about who is putting up this graffiti all over town, we aren't scared. Here is a picture of Together SF Action doing the deed. What are you going to do, fine us??





And since we are important we have shifted the political dialog. Not only are we calling for winnowing out the addicts by denigrating harm reduction, but now we are winnowing out politicians as well! (Note: this picture not endorsed by Harvey Milk Club for some reason).
