These ungainly contraptions often have huge security and compliance gaps, are completely unmaintainable, and took ages to spin up in the first place. 

Workflow changes all that, moving a previously opaque and mystical process into a friendly UI/UX experience, making AI Data movement as easy as dropbox, and all with an eye to long term maintenance and economics.Join the movementDiffgram is the only Community Validated Commerical StandardStar now1,721Get started with DiffgramSend us a messagePlaygroundCareersGet startedÂ© 2023 Diffgram, Inc.
