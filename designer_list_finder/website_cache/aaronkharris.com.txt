Aaron HarrisHomeAboutInvestmentsBooksBlogPhotosDeck ReviewI’m Aaron Harris.This website will tell you a bit about me. I am building Magid & Co. I was a partner at Y Combinator for 7.5 years. I ran a company called Tutorspree for 3 years. I’m reasonably sure I’ve seen everything that can happen to an early stage company, and much of what happens at later stages. I particularly enjoy working with founders to figure out just how much they can change the future. I like making photographs.
