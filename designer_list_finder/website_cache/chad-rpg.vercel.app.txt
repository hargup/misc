Game's Open Back Again
But free bard API is not responding stable sometimes as it is an experiment ai. I'll try to
		minimize bugs by game prompt and error handling but ultimate solution is a stable chat api. So
		don't take your games so seriously for now, as it may get stuck at the most enjoyable moment.
	
Game carried from chatgpt to bard's unofficial free api, not the best chatbot solution but
			only free solution i've found for now.
		
Sadly, creating a save system is not possible without a stable chat api, So only quick games
			can be played for now.
		
PR's - ideas are all welcome! (Especially in game prompt.)
You can share me the bugs u've encountered.
Okay
