Tonga Room


&
Hurricane Bar

 
A San Francisco institution since 1945, the famous Tonga Room with its thatched huts and island décor is as much a delightfully immersive experience as tiki-style restaurant and lounge. Share a pupu platter and other Polynesian favorites with tropical cocktails in faux coconuts, and watch the band play from the lagoon barge. This is a grand adventure in San Francisco.
