It embeds all-in-one:an execution runtime to execute functions at scale with low-latency and no overhead on a fleet of workersan orchestrator to compose functions into powerful flows at low-latency built with a low-code builder (or yaml if that's your thing)an app builder to build application and data-intensive dashboards built with low-code or JS frameworks such a React.Windmill can be used solely from its UI through its webIDE, and low-code builders but it is also possible to keep using your editor and deploy from a git repo using a CLI.Start building now using our Cloud App (no credit card required) or Self-Host yourself.Learn about Windmill​Get Started with WindmillGet started in 30 seconds.Note of IntentWindmill bridges the gap between no-code/low-code services and traditional programming.Quick Overview of Windmill​Windmill is a feature-rich platform that allows you to build endpoints, cron jobs, workflows & UIs. Each of these features can be used standalone.However the 3 core layers of Windmill, namely Scripts, Flows and Apps are complementary. Scripts are the smallest "unit" of abstraction: workflows and UIs all rely on them.ScriptsScripts are the basic building blocks that can be written in Typescript, Python, Go, Bash, SQL or launch docker containers.FlowsFlows are state machines represented as DAGs that compose steps together to build workflows and ETLs.AppsApps are customized, user-friendly interfaces built using a drag-and-drop editor.Learn more about Windmill​Core ConceptsThe essential principles and features that underpin the platform's capabilities.IntegrationsWindmill provides a framework to easily add integrations.Triggering ScriptsTrigger flows on-demand, by schedule or on external events.Triggering FlowsTrigger flows on-demand, by schedule or on external events.Script EditorLow-code editor to build scripts.Flow EditorLow-code editor to build workflows.App EditorDrag-and-drop editor to build apps.Windmill for Developers​Command-Line InterfaceInteract with Windmill instances right from your terminal.Local DevelopmentDevelop from various environments such as your terminal, VSCode, and JetBrains IDEs.Version control from GitHub/GitLabUse a GH/GL repo as the source of truth for part or all of your Windmill workspace.Run Docker ContainersWindmill supports running any docker container through its bash integration.Comparisons​BenchmarksWindmill has about the same performance as AWS Lambda for heavier workloads, but it is slower on cold starts for medium compute.Windmill Compared to PeersOur subjective impression on other players you might come across.NextGet Started with WindmillLearn about WindmillQuick Overview of WindmillLearn more about WindmillWindmill for DevelopersComparisons
