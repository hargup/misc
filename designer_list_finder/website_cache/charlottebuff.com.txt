Charlotte’s Web Zone

Hello! 🐸
Welcome to my personal web zone! I don’t really know what to put here yet, so for now I’m just gonna use this place for storing miscellaneous documents and toys and things. Some of it is also randomly going to be in German.
This web zone was achieved with state‐of‐the‐art HTML5 and CSS3 technology. Please enable JavaScript 🥺.
Current Estradiol Colour: [🔵]


About me
My CS teacher once took a point off my grade because he had to scroll down to see the entirety of my project’s landing page, so now I’m making this shit extra long out of spite.

My name is Charlotte Eiffel Lilith Buff, but you can call me Lotte or Lily. You may remember me from such Unicode proposals as Canonical Combining Classes of Znamenny Notation Characters (revised) and Proposal to Add a Salt Shaker Emoji to the Unicode Standard.
I’m a 25‑year‐old transfem enby from Germany (ugh) and also a frog. Read all about my pronouns here. I suppose I could be described as a programmer, but I don’t do a lot of programming nowadays because of brain reasons. I would like to, though.
Actually, I’d describe myself as a vexillologist first and foremost. I love flags – I would die for them. My favourite national flag is Nepal’s because it isn’t a rectangle. Oh, and you can see an elongated version of my personal flag tastefully decorating the top of this web zone.
My other interests include but are not limited to: Small metal objects, cartography, the Japanese language, anime (shocking, I know), science fiction with lots of blinking lights, voice actors, quantum chromodynamics, colourful socks, astronomy, cladistics, deep‐sea invertebrates, video games (I play like three of them), railway infrastructure, and obscure synth music for some reason.
Writing this “about me” stuff is actually really hard. Erm, I watch a lot of YouTube videos. My favourite colour is yellow. I drink tea, preferably fennel. I enjoy photographing clouds. Sometimes I write stories and such that never get finished because I run out of plot ideas around page 10. I’m pansexual and aromantic. The best Danganronpa character is K1‑B0.
