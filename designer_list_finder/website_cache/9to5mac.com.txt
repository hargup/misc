Hermès has made a commitment to Apple to create more environmentally friendly bands, but it turns out that the brand will continue to sell Apple Watches with leather bands.

Last year, Apple announced its ambitious plans to put an end to the old SIM card by making iPhone 14 the first eSIM-only iPhone… except for those living anywhere outside the US. Despite some rumors suggesting that Apple would expand the eSIM-only iPhone to more countries, the US is still the only country to have the iPhone 15 without a physical SIM tray.

When a company claims to offer the “ultimate” drop-proof case, you’d want to ask a few searching questions. But SUPCASE does have all the right answers for its Unicorn Beetle PRO, aka the UB Pro.
The UB Pro won CNET’s first annual drop test, notching up the award for the highest fall without damage. It went on to protect an iPhone against an astonishing 50-foot drop test by Everything Apple Pro, and has survived all manner of attacks, up to and including stopping a bullet … 
For a limited time, you can get 15% off with the code 159TO5MAC from the company’s Amazon store (valid until October 6).

During the September keynote event, Apple touted a whole bunch of new Portrait mode features for the iPhone 15 series, like automatic capture of Portrait mode shots while using the main shooting mode in the Camera app and the ability to change the subject in focus in the Portrait mode shot after you have taken it.
Well, it turns out that at least some of that stuff is also coming to older phones too. Twitter user Dylan pointed out that on the iOS 17 release candidate build, iPhone 14 Pro users can also refocus their Portrait mode shots after they have been taken.
