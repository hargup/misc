Compliance
Protect your revenue, simplify PSD2 compliance


      Since September 2019, PSD2 regulation requires your European customers to provide Strong Customer Authentication for subscription and invoice payments. Stripe Billing helps protect your revenue by identifying which charges require SCA and triggering 3D Secure authentication when required.
    







Minimize churn


      Banks will decline recurring payments that require SCA unless you obtain authentication from customers. Stripe can automatically email your subscribers to request 3D Secure authentication and minimize involuntary churn. You can customize the emails to match your brand and create reminders if customers don’t take action.
    







Confirm your $9.99 payment
Please confirm your monthly payment to Typographic using Visa Secure. Your bank requires this security measure for your card ending in 4242.
Confirm payment







Confirm payment


      Stripe Billing lets you send invoices with built-in support for credit and debit cards. The hosted invoice page detects which payments require SCA and seamlessly requests 3D Secure authentication as part of the payment process.

Global templates


      Send compliant invoices in 13 languages and configure custom text fields, footers, and memos to display all the necessary customer and product information.
    
























Flexible tax collection


      Manually apply tax rates to individual line items or whole invoices. Or, use Stripe Tax to automatically calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST in your invoices.
    




Match your brand


      Customize the look and feel of invoices by adding your logo and selecting the color palette. You can even add a personal message, like a thank-you note.
    





A more efficient way to accept wire transfers and ACH


      While often more effective for larger invoice amounts, supporting payment methods like ACH and wires can require tedious and manual accounts receivable efforts. Stripe Billing automates how businesses support B2B payment methods.
    






Automate reconciliation


      Stripe generates virtual bank account numbers to keep your company’s banking details private and automatically reconciles incoming payments with outstanding invoices.

Retention
From one-time order to lifetime customer


      Automate every part of recurring relationships—from managing customer events to retrying failed payments at the ideal time.
    





Reduce involuntary churn


      Nearly a quarter of churn is involuntary—it’s caused by missed payments or declined cards. And 43% of recurring revenue businesses expect customer churn will continue to increase. Stripe’s dunning tools help businesses recover 38% of failed recurring payments on average, and businesses using our Smart Retries recover 11% more revenue than those retrying failed payments on a set schedule. In 2022, Stripe’s recovery tools helped businesses recover $3.85 billion in revenue.
    







    We recovered 12% of revenue through Stripe Billing’s automatic card updater.
  



Bench logo









Automatic card updater


      Stripe works directly with card networks to update payment details with new card numbers or expiry dates.
    




Smart retry logic


      Machine learning algorithms train on data from across the Stripe network to optimize retry logic and failed payments.
    




Automatic reminders


      Maximize your chances of getting paid with prebuilt email reminders for missed or overdue payments.
    





Optimize the customer lifecycle


      Use Stripe as a system of record for the customer lifecycle: manage important events such as automatically provisioning services for new subscribers or sending reminders for renewals. You can also enable your customers to self-manage their subscriptions with the customer portal.

Build vs. buy
Building your own subscription and billing management software requires significant investment, and it’s flat-out difficult to get right.





      Businesses often cobble something together to support an initial launch, but underestimate the complexity and costs down the line. A homegrown solution needs to be continuously maintained to support new product launches, business models, pricing experiments, global expansion, changes in regulatory requirements, and a host of other challenges as business grows.
    



      Stripe Billing offers the functionality you need to quickly get started today, but with the flexibility and features to support you at scale, so you can focus on building your business.
