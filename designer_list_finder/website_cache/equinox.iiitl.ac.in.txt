About

              ideate, share and express their concerns, opinions and thoughts
              about rebuilding the global enterprises. The current COVID-19
              pandemic has hit the global markets hard, weakening
              international trade and cooperation. This platform will bring
              together global leaders from across all sectors to discuss and
              deliberate strategies and to showcase business growth, new
              operation models and tech innovations. The conclave gives a
              golden opportunity to inquisitive minds to interact with and get
              inspired by these leaders.
            


Theme

              In recent times, the global economy has surged to new heights.
              However, the unprecedented success also revealed the flaws in
              how the traditional businesses were being operated. Especially
              since the pandemic, the need to rebuild the global enterprise
              became more and more apparent. The ideologies regarding building
              an empire are shifting and leaning towards new, uncharted modern
              territories. Technology also plays a key factor in this
              progression. The rise of technology has also posed a new
              question, what exactly does it take to rebuild the global
              enterprise?
