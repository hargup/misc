It's similar to what we frequently describe as being "in the zone," characterized by a deep sense of immersion and peak performance.This concept of "flow" was first introduced to the broader scientific community by Csikszentmihalyi in 1990 through his seminal work, "Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience". In this publication, he articulated the essence of being in flow and its significant benefits. Not only does it boost productivity, but it also increases life satisfaction and promotes better mental wellbeing. The study of flow began with Csikszentmihalyi's quest to identify the elements that lead to a life worth living, which you can hear about in his TED Talk:Â Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: Flow, the Secret to Happiness.As modern knowledge workers, we rarely get to experience flow state. Even more elusive is the sense of progression and mastery of your work. When was the last time you felt accomplished? Do you feel like you are better than you were a month ago? The pursuit of flow state reminds us to asks these questions about the work we do everyday, and Flow Club is where we gather to do it.How do I get in the flow?While flow is a highly personal and subjective experience, researchers have identified conditions that can facilitate this positive state of being:â¢ Challenge-Skill Balance: Choose activities that are just challenging enough for your skill level. Progress to bigger challenges as your skills expand. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi provides two insightful graphs to help visualize where you should aim to be.â¢ Clear, Attainable Goals: Have a clear understanding of what you need to accomplish. If your tasks seem too vague, refine them until they become more specific. If your tasks seem overwhelming, break them down into manageable pieces.â¢ Unambiguous Feedback: You should know how well youâre doing as youâre doing it. Even with extensive and protracted tasks, set smaller milestones to help you gauge progress along the way.â¢ Time-based Goals: When breaking down tasks or clarifying them proves difficult, use time-based goals rather than outcome-based goals. For example, if you're facing a major task, such as writing a lengthy report without a clear plan, set a goal like "write for 30 minutes." Make focusing for a specific period of time the goal itself.â¢ Follow Your Energy Level: Pay attention to how your energy fluctuates throughout the day. Take advantage of the peak energy times to enhance your chances of achieving flow.â¢ Designate Time: Schedule time to be in flow to block it out for yourself. Commit and let your brain prepare to fully immerse itself when the time arrives.â¢ Eliminate Distraction: Before you start, eliminate any potential distractions. Place your phone out of reach and out of sight, close your room door, set your chat program to "Do Not Disturb,â etc.â¢ Bring Intention: Bring a heightened level of intention and determination. This could be as simple as taking a deep breath, focusing your gaze, or performing a brief ritual that helps you transition into a more concentrated state.â¢ Bring Personal Triggers: Recognize and leverage personal triggers that help you enter the zone. These could be a cup of coffee, a specific playlist, or a notebook open to a particular page.â¢ Be In a Flow-Inducing Environment (eg Flow Club): Flow Club is a virtual environment designed to facilitate flow state that you can access any time, from anywhere. Some key features of an optimal flow-inducing environment include:- Encouraging risk-taking through peer accountability- Activating reward pathways to stimulate dopamine release- Offering soundtracks conducive to work- Inspiring awe and motivation- Providing a comfortable and supportive atmosphereWhat is the Flow Score?After every Flow Club session, you have an opportunity to give yourself a Flow Score rating from 1-10, with 10 being âtotally immersed in flow.â The purpose is to help you reflect and ultimately better understand how you can experience flow more regularly.Flow is a subjective experience that feels like effortless effort. To help you reflect more accurately, here are some questions you can ask yourself when rating your experience:ââ¢ Challenge-Skill Balance: My skills allowed me to meet the challengeâ¢ Clear Goals: I knew what I wanted to doâ¢ Unambiguous Feedback: I knew how well I was doingâ¢ Autotelic Experience: I loved the feeling of what I was doing, and want to feel it againâ¢ Time Distortion: Time appeared to speed up or slow downâ¢ Total Concentration: I had no difficulty focusingâ¢ Sense of Control: I felt in controlâ¢ Loss of Self-Consciousness: I was not worried about others or critical of myselfâ¢ Action-Awareness Merging: I moved seamlessly from thinking to actingWhat are the benefits of Flow Club?Flow Club creates the conditions to help facilitate flow state. It's ultimately about improving mental fitness, feeling fulfilled at work and finding more time for life. The specific benefits you will experience include but are not limited to:â¢ Sharpened focusâ¢ Minimized distractionsâ¢ Manage symptoms of ADHDâ¢ Heightened intentionality and awareness of your workâ¢ Motivation on demandâ¢ More time for deep work, side pursuits, and lifeâ¢ Increased confidence through a sense of agencyâ¢ Clearer delineation between work and restâ¢ More restorative restâ¢ Inspired company of peers and hostsâ¢ Lower stress and anxietyâ¢ More creativityWe hate BS too, and some of these things inevitably sound like BS. Best we can do now is to show you some testimonials, but you should stay skeptical and try it out for yourself. âSee our Wall of Love. How do you know that your method works?Flow Clubâs method is based on the popular Pomodoro Technique, which millions of workers around the world practice on a daily basis. The Pomodoro Technique helps people overcome discomfort by working in small time increments of 25-minutes, followed by a 5-minute of break. In Flow Club, the most popular length of session is 50 minutes.âResearch shows that we put off work not because we are lazy or lack discipline. We do it to avoid negative feelings like overwhelm and uncertainty. We reach for distractions to soothe our negative feelings or busy work to help us feel productive. Instead, the Pomodoro Technique helps you focus by shrinking your goal down to the next few things you can do in the time allotted, making it easier for anyone to make real progress.Beyond the Pomodoro Technique, FlowÂ Club is intentionally designed to facilitate flow state and overcome symptoms of ADHD.

This concept is actually called body doubling and is a useful technique for everyone to remain focused, present and reduce distractions.The video boxes are small, and no one is looking at you because everyone is focusing. In case things go wrong, we enforce our community guidelines to keep out bad behavior. How much talking is required?Not much at all because we gather to focus on getting stuff done.
