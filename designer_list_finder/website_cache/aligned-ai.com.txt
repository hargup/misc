AIs that are guaranteed to operate in your interests, including in situations where itâs not easy to determine what your interests are, is the core of alignment. This means that the AI can be trusted to perform more tasks without causing errors or needing human oversight.Power Through SafetyOur Approach Safer AI is more adoptable AI. If you canât trust an AI to do what you intend for it to do, then it is not applicable for important or high risk situations. That's why we're putting safety at the heart of everything we do.The root of the problemOur ScienceGetting AI to do what we want it to do has been the main challenge of the field since 1956. Despite recent progress, this remains unsolved. Weâre getting closer with concept extrapolation.Making AIs saferOur ApplicationsWeâre making AIs safer today by building tools that can be integrated into current systems. But weâre also building the safest and most aligned AI system from the ground up.Featured MediaFeatured MediaLetter: Have you met my artificial intelligence PA?The EUâs AI Act needs to address critical manipulation methodsSome small startups making headway on generative A.I.âs biggest challengesHelping A.I. understand the world like a humanÂ©2023 Aligned AIInvestorsPressCareersÂ©2023 Aligned AIInvestorsPressCareersÂ©2023 Aligned AIInvestorsPressCareers
