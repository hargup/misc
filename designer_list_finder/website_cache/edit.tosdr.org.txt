Terms of Service; Didn't Read
  

“I have read and agree to the Terms” is the biggest lie on the web. We aim to fix that.
  

Welcome to our edit tool
Using this online tool, you can help to update the content of the ToS;DR website. Below are the most recent changes people have made. Above, you can see the menu bar, where you can navigate to the list of Services, or the Points search page.

How it works
A service is a website or online application, for instance YouTube. A case is an individual remark that can form part of the review of a service, for instance "you need to be 13 years old to use this service"; each is assigned a topic to provide grouping. A point links a case to a service, for instance "you need to be 13 years old to use YouTube".
To review a service's terms and conditions, first make sure the service is listed, and raise it on the reviewers forum if it isn't. Then read the actual terms and policies you have to agree to to use this service, and make a note about anything that you find remarkable. Find the existing case for each of these review remarks, or create it if necessary, and create a point to add that case as a remark in the review of the service. Use the checklist to see if you forgot to review any aspects.
Then you need to wait for a curator to approve your changes, after which your review will show up on https://tosdr.org, will be picked up by the ToS;DR browser extensions, and included in DuckDuckGo's Privacy Grade, for which our API is one of several input factors. For services whose terms and policies are tracked by ToSBack, you can try out our experimental annotate view.
This tool is still very much under construction, and has bugs. Please open a github issue for anything you think should be improved.

  <p>Please take time to read the provisions below carefully, because they are legally binding.
  Provisions which are italicised are particularly important: these include the provisions governing content you upload in clause 5, the restrictions in clause 6, which are important to protect our ownership of intellectual property rights in Fluency Tutor, and the limitations of liability in clause&nbsp;11.
  Finally, please note that Fluency Tutor offers in-app purchases to which these terms of use relate.</p>
  <ol>

  By accepting these User Terms you agree to be bound by their effect.</li>
  <li>Fluency Tutor may be made available to you over various third party software application distribution platforms.
  Any such third party may require us to impose contractual terms between you and us in addition to these User Terms.
  In the event that any such provisions are imposed, you undertake fully to comply with the same and such terms shall be deemed part of these User Terms.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
  <li>ACCEPTING THE USER TERMS</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In order to use Fluency Tutor, you must first agree to these User Terms.

  or</li>
  <li>by actually using Fluency Tutor.
  In this case, you understand and agree that we will treat your use of Fluency Tutor as acceptance of the User Terms from that point onwards.</li>
  <li>USE OF FLUENCY TUTOR BY YOU AND STUDENTS</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>

  If you use Fluency Tutor to monitor/review students reading, to set them reading tasks, to control what content the students will have access to, and/or to make use of analytics/data tools on Fluency Tutor, then you are considered a Teacher User.
  We also provide services aimed at students that don’t include most of the Teacher User features and allow you to focus on the reading tasks and those functions that assist with your reading.
  Such a user would be considered to be a Student User.
  &nbsp;If you are:</p>
  <p>5.
  a Teacher User, you undertake that prior to interacting with any Student User through Fluency Tutor you will make this privacy notice available to them and procure that Student User’s agreement, and where such Student User is under the age of 13, their parent’s or guardian’s agreement, to be bound by these User Terms on their behalf, as if ‘you’ and ‘your’ referred to that person where appropriate.
  You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to procure such compliance.
  &nbsp.
  </p>
  <p>6.

  &nbsp.
  &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Fluency Tutor is NOT a back up service.
  In particular, you acknowledge and agree that no refund will be due to you from us in the event of service failure, and you further acknowledge and agree that since we have no control over the content and/or quality of content (including User Content and Third Party Content) this limitation of our liability to you is reasonable.</li>

  You acknowledge and agree that we are not liable in relation to such third party cookies and that they are the sole responsibility of the third party cookie provider.

  &nbsp;</li>
  <li>There are no conditions, warranties, representations or other terms, express or implied, that are binding on us except as specifically stated in these User Terms (including implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement).
  &nbsp;Any condition, warranty, representation or other term concerning the supply of Fluency Tutor which might otherwise be implied into or incorporated in these User Terms, or any collateral contract, whether by statute, common law or otherwise, is hereby excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.</li>
  <li>You expressly understand and so agree that your use of Fluency Tutor is at your sole risk and that Fluency Tutor is provided "As Is" and "As Available."</li>
  <li>In particular, we, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our licensors, do not represent or warrant to you that:</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
  <li>your use of Fluency Tutor (including its use in conjunction with any other software) will meet your requirements, that your use of Fluency Tutor will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or free from error or that defects in the operation or functionality of Fluency Tutor provided to you will be corrected.
  and</li>
  <li>any information obtained by you as a result of your use of Fluency Tutor will be accurate or reliable;</li>
  <li>any content (including User Content and Third Party Content) will be of any particular standard and/or quality (and we expressly disclaim any liability for any loss, damage, cost, claim and/or expense incurred by you and/or any third party as a result of your and/or their accessing such content via Fluency Tutor, including in respect of any claim or action relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights);</li>
  <li>that any content (including User Content and Third Party Content) will be accessible at any particular time;</li>
  <li>that Fluency Tutor will be secure or free from bugs or viruses.
  and</li>
  <li>that defects in the operation or functionality of the Fluency Tutor will be corrected, rectified, or remedied.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
  <li>Any material (including User Content and Third Party Content) downloaded or otherwise obtained or accessed through the use of Fluency Tutor is done at your own discretion and risk, and that you will be solely responsible for any damage, loss, or prejudice to your computer system or other device or loss of data that results from the download or access of any such material.</li>
  <li>In order for you to make full use of Fluency Tutor it may be necessary for you to use particular computer equipment or to download or install certain pieces of software.
  If you are unable to access all or part of Fluency Tutor because you do not have access to any necessary software or equipment, this shall not constitute a breach of these User Terms by us and we shall not be liable for any loss, damage or expense which may result from your inability to access Fluency Tutor.</li>
  <li>No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or any of our subsidiaries, affiliates, officials, employees, or personnel, or through or from Fluency Tutor shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these User Terms.
  We shall not be under any liability whatsoever in respect of any inaccuracies or omissions in Fluency Tutor.
  All such liability is excluded by us to the fullest extent permitted by law.</li>
  <li>You expressly understand and agree that we and our licensors shall not be liable to you for:</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
  <li>any indirect, special, incidental or consequential loss or damage which may arise in respect of Fluency Tutor and/or its use or non-availability;</li>
  <li>loss of profit, business revenue, goodwill and anticipated savings:</li>
  <li>any trading or other losses which you may incur as a result of use of or reliance upon any content;</li>
  <li>the deletion of, corruption of, or failure to store, any content and other data maintained or transmitted by or through your use of Fluency Tutor;</li>
  <li>any loss or damage caused by a virus, distributed denial-of-service attack, or other technologically harmful material that may infect your computer equipment, computer programs, data or other proprietary material due to your use of Fluency Tutor or to your downloading of any content on it, or on any website linked to it.
  or</li>
  <li>any effect which use of Fluency Tutor may have on any software you use.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>13.
  Our total aggregate liability for any loss, claim, cost, damages and/or expense incurred by you as a result of your or any third party’s use of Fluency Tutor shall be limited to 100% of the last annual subscription fee paid by you to us.
  In the event that you have made no such payment, our total aggregate liability shall be £25.
  In view of the fact that you are not required to make any payment for the license granted under these User Terms, you acknowledge that this limitation on our liability is reasonable.</p>
  <p>14.
  You agree and acknowledge that you are in a better position than us to foresee and evaluate any potential damage or loss which you may suffer in connection with the use of Fluency Tutor.
  that we cannot adequately insure its potential liability to you.
  and that accordingly the exclusions and limitations contained in this clause 9 are reasonable.
  You also undertake at all times to mitigate any such damage or loss.</p>
