Melinda Self

We like the document attachment feature so we can share briefs and procedures. I even get the posts on my Apple watch, which is great if I’m in a meeting and want to take a quick peek to see if something urgent has come up. Our work is hard and using GIFs makes it much more pleasurable.



Jacob Hopson

“We value Chanty because of the ability to have all work related conversations in one place. We also enjoy being able to send files back and forth. Being able to access Chanty from anywhere is a huge advantage if one of us has an urgent issue we need feedback on.”



Fabian Krieger

“Thanks, you are my new BFF... Making Chanty more fun and better than Slack! I'll support you guys all the way :)”



Julia Dadds

“I like the simplicity of the platform and yet it has the major features we need.”



David Oragui

“Seems like you've got a great product. The UI is amazing, please keep up the good work.”



Tu Bui

“We certainly love the simple interface and the chats, tasks, files and links are put together in an easy way to use”



Amilcar De Carvalho

“Slack was too slow for my phone, and didn't have audio messages, which is crucial for me as I enjoy working while walking with my dog in nature and Microsoft was too complex to use. Finally no more whatsapp for communications and audio messages, which makes us extremely focused.”
