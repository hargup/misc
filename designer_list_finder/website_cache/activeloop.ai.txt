Deep Lake is multi-modal, which means we support any AI data - and not just embeddings. Deep Lake combines the power of both Data Lakes & Vector Databases to build, fine-tune, & deploy enterprise-grade LLM solutions, & iteratively improve them over time.>Â pipÂ installÂ deeplakeDive into Deep LakeServerless Tensor Query EngineVector search does not resolve retrieval. To solve it, you need a serverless query for multi-modal data, including embeddings or metadata. Filter, search, & more from the cloud or your laptopVisualize & Version DataVisualize and understand your data, as well as the embeddings.

Deep Lake's on-the-fly streaming was an excellent choice for us: it was really easy to set up, and it started to bring the value from day one.âArsenii GorinLead ML EngineerUbenwa AIâJust needed to deploy a solution that works - and Activeloop made it simpler to ship our AI app quickly!âMargaux Masson-ForsytheDirector, Machine LearningSDSCâThey started out with a vector store integration, so it's flown under the radar, but... @activeloopai's Deep Lake is an intriguing fully-fledged serverless data lake that supports attribute based filtering, multiple distance functions, MMR search.âHarrison ChaseCEO & FounderLangChainAIâAwesome!âLouis BouchardResearcherMILA QuebecIncredible tool! One of our researchers at National Center for Supercomputing Applications had great success using Deep Lake for multimodal pipelining for self supervised video embeddings. We are now trying to move away from HDF5's as they are too slow, annoying to work with, and just don't have the features we need to pipe efficiently into PyTorch. Exciting!Priyam MazumdarResearcherNCSAâA 100x speedup of Tensor Query execution for semantic search and question answering on legal documents. Deep Lakeâs minimalistic architecture provided flexibility and light touch installation for our customers without introducing complexity such as adding a microservice. With Deep Lakeâs ultrafast data loader, PyTorch was able to natively access the data and distribute it automatically across MPI workers, allowing for highly parallel embedding search.âGevorg KarapetyanCTOZeroâDavit & team are super responsive & hands-on with onboarding. Highly recommend the tool for managing large & complex datasets.âTony FrancisCo-FounderDream 3DâNew models deployed in a matter of days instead of weeks.âJennifer HobbsDirector, Machine LearningIntelinAirYour ML projects will never be dead in the water(If you use Deep Lake)Access DataCreate Datasets ManuallyCreate Datasets AutomaticallyPlug into LangChainConnect to ML Frameworks1import deeplake
