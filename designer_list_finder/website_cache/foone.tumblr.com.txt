ADHD person who manages it by using an ability to effectly pause time so they can do weeks of work overnight but time still passes for them, so sometimes you’ll see them and they suddenly look months older, hair has grown out and it’s turning grey now, and you say “another big deadline, eh?”. There are bags under their eyes

Because I know there are a lot of people who have Feelings about being a mech pilot, I'll just share the guide qdot wrote to hook up AC6 to a buttplug.io compatible sex toy of your choice:Using the Game Haptics Router with Armored Core 6 (Steam Edition)
                    Here’s a quick guide to using the GHR with AC6 on PC. Note that this will assume:   You’re playing on PC You purchased the game via Steam  Y                
                Buttplug.io and Intiface® Support

I like how many times they beg you to not be weird about this on the first page. But I have questions about the specifics.Is it set up to vibrate when you get hit, like normal controller feedback systems? Because that seems like it would have counterproductive training effects. Conversely does it award you for killing people? Because I'm not sure how to feel about training yourself to feel sexual pleasure when you end the lives of others.Does the signal go both ways? Can you map some of the controls of your mech to clenching in a specific way?












foone



I believe this is just creatively rerouting the existing rumble signals to some sex toy. So yeah, if the game rumbles when you get hit, you'd have vibration then. Making it trigger with specific in-game events would require a dedicated game mod, which I don't think can be done yet because of DRM.And it's one way, sadly 












lollyde



Oh, dont worry, it's a fromsoft game, they practically do not have drm. Fromsoft has been using variations of the same engine since at least dark souls 1, and the modding scene has made a ridiculous number of tools for it - a lot of which dont need *too* many adjustments to work with ac6. In fact, their models and texture related tools already work - zulliethewitch for example already has pasted an armored core model into elden ring for a size comparison video on youtube (theyre huge!)tldr: buttplug reinforced killing might happen sooner than you think












foone



apparently they’re using Easy Anti-Cheat because of the online PVP aspects, which I imagine could easily be triggered by trying to interface with the game.I don’t know, though. this is one of the reason I focus on hacking games from the 90s and shit: less weird DRM/anti-cheat stuff to deal with.

tawghasa asked:

Can you tell us more about the keyboard with the built-in siren?







So I’ve been calling it the “TI Monster”. It’s got a bunch of custom specialized keys, and it’s a nasty rubber abomination that’s clearly designed to be used in some kind of industrial setting. It’s got a keylock, a real key-lock: You have to put in a key to turn it on! The actual technical info is that it’s a TI PN 2594710-0001 REV A Serial Keyboard. This is designed for some kind of PLC (programmable logic controller) system, but I have no idea which one. I’ve never gotten it working, because it has this little controller board that seems to be fried:So I’d have to build my own controller to get it working, and I just haven’t ever done that. You can see there’s a little speaker on the controller, but that’s just for key-click. The real sound output is that SONALERT connector in the top right… Which connects to this: A Sonalert SC616N, capable of 95 dB at 2 feet distance. That’s equivalent to a car horn at a distance of 16 feet. But yeah. I think the idea was that this keyboard was used with some industrial thing that was gonna be used on a loud factory floor, and the keyboard was the only part they knew was gonna be placed anywhere near an operator. So they built a siren into that part to be sure that it could be heard over the factory noise if something went wrong. I’ve never tried powering the siren: I am misophonic and hate the idea of it existing.

Concept: a woman is holding hands with a robot, and the woman is wearing a shirt that says "I like my women like I like my keyboards" on the front and "mechanical" on the back, over an exploded view of a cherry mx brown keyswitch.The robot's shirt says "flesh lover" in the old recaptcha distorted text style. The back has "select all the squares with the cutest girl" and a 3x3 montage of photos of the woman currently holding her right hand.

obligatory Gee, I sure wish robots were shoving their lesbianism down MY throat!












kaywii



I would draw this, but I am not sure what "exploded view of a cherry mx brown keyswitch" is, and I am not sure what a "recaptcha distorted text style" looks like












kaiasky



exploded view is this, where the parts are shown vertically above one another, in the positions they'd fit togetherALTrecaptcha distorted text is the way reCAPTCHA v1.0 used text that looked like thisALT

So it turns out I’m on Observation Duty has accurate morse code in the intro scroll. It’s very shortened, but it’s accurate. What’s not accurate is that they reused the message for the “too many anomalies” warning, where it’s not exactly relevant, but also that message is shorter, so they just… cut off the WAV file mid-word.This results in the word “ANOMALY” (.- -. — – .- .-.. -.–) getting truncated to “ANOMAR” (.- -. — – .- .-.)what the fuck is a an ANOMAR, Notovia? how am I supposed to send an anomar? IT RAISES SO MANY QUESTIONS

creepycrag asked:

mx brown gang!! don't listen to the haters. although that might be hard since their keyboards are so fucking loud







*THAKKATHAKKATHAKKA*what? I couldn’t hear you. (The funny thing is that I own several actual IBM Model Ms, which make other keyboards seem silent. if I wanted to blast loud keyboards, I could! Hell, I own a keyboard which comes with a built in SIREN, I could legitimately cause hearing damage with that)
