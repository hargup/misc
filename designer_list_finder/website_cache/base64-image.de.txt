File Formats

                You can upload up to 20 images (max. 1.00 MB each) as JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG or BMP.

                Please note that Internet Explorer 8 has a limit of 32 KB for data URI.
                Versions below have no support.
            





Image optimization

                We can optimize your JPEG & PNG images, using jpegoptim and
                optipng. This will reduce the file without any visible impact
                (in most cases).
            

                Optimization status:
