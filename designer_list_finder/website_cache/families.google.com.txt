How does a family group work?









When you create a family group, you become the family manager. This means you can invite up to 5 other people to join and if they accept your invitation, theyâll be added to your family group. Family managers can delete the group, invite, or remove members at any time. Get started by creating your family group now.


 




How much does a family group cost?









Creating or joining a family group doesnât require a paid membership or subscription. A family group allows you and your family group members to get more out of the Google products you already use. Some Google products require purchasing family plan subscriptions for premium services.


 




What can I share in a family group?









Once you create a family group, you'll see a list of Google apps and services that the family manager can choose from for the family to share.


 




I have kids in my family group. How are they supervised?









Family managers can manage their parental controls for supervised accounts in a family group. The family manager can also give another parent parental permissions to help manage a supervised account.


 




Are there any restrictions or requirements?









To create a family group, you must be 18 or older (or the applicable age of consent in your country). In order to join your family group, the people you invite must have a Google Account. People can only join one family group at a time and they can only switch to another family group once every 12 months.


 




Are family group and Family Link related?









Family group and Family Link are two different services that can work together. With a family group youâre able to share your favorite apps and services like YouTube, Play Family Library, Google Assistant, and more.


When you create a child account in your family group, thatâs where Family Link comes in. Family Link allows you to set digital ground rules for your childâs account such as restricting content, approving app downloads and purchases, setting screen time and more. Learn more about Family Link.
