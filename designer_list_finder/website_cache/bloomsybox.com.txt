My bae is quite happy, so I am.— Eliza Bailey Loved to see my velvet bouquet. It was perfectly arranged and covered with a beautiful wrapping. Looking forward to ordering some more flowers next week.— Debra Parker Fresh sunflowers just made the day... I thought I had to spend some minutes in arranging the flowers coz it was for my best friend, but loved the perfection in making the bouquet with creativity.— Kenny Parry I often gift use Bloomsy Box. Every time they prove that their services are mind-blowing. They make sure that the flowers are fresh and are delivered to their clients without getting damaged. 10/10.— Scott Cooper I’m confident saying that no other site can send so gorgeous & fresh roses like bloomsybox!
