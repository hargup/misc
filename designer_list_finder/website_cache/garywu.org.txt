Gary Wu

      I like building stuff. Currently building
      Treecard. Previously built
      Fluidstack.
      
      Before that, I studied economics at Oxford and am a self-taught software
      engineer.
    

      I've done some angel investing, including into Varda, Prosper, and Flux Marine.
