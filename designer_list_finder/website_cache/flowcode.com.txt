Frequently asked questionsQuestions not answered?Visit help center


What is a direct to consumer company?Being a direct to consumer company means you can connect with your customers without any middlemen between you and your product. For example, using QR codes allow you to instantly connect the scanner to your online products, website, social profiles, or CRM collection tools.What is the best QR code generator?While there are multiple QR code generator platforms available, not all offer the same services and privacy protection. If youâre searching for a platform that provides enhanced customization features, real-time data, integrations, and GDPR and CCPA privacy protection, Flowcode is the best option for you.Are QR codes a privacy risk?Not all QR code generators have privacy in mind, so itâs very important for you to research the platform you build on. If privacy is one of your top priorities, the strongest company you can rely on is Flowcode. With GDPR and CCPA compliance and a privacy policy visible on every code produced, Flowcode is the #1 most trusted QR code solution.What are Flowcodeâs privacy policies?Flowcode takes privacy seriously. When you scan a Flowcode, there is no question where that code was generated. All of our codes include the text âprivacy.flowcode.comâ or our company name, âFlowcodeâ, which should be considered a badge of safety. While other QR code platforms may not have privacy information on their codes, this can be considered a security risk. Because of phishing attempts and QR code scams on the rise, itâs important to work with companies like Flowcode who ensure every code you scan is a safe one.What software integrations are offered by Flowcode?If youâre searching for a QR code platform to integrate with tools you already use, Flowcode is the best tool for your business. From Klavyio and Mailchimp to Salesforce and Okta, some of the biggest CRM tools, ESPs, and business management solutions integrate with Flowcode.What industries does Flowcode serve?From Fortune 1000s to neighborhood coffee shops, Flowcode serves a wide range of businesses, creators, and companies of all sizes. Common industries where youâll see Flowcodes are entertainment, event, sports, real estate, consumer packaged goods, design â but the list goes on. Virtually every industry can benefit from using Flowcode QR codes to connect with their audience. Afterall, we work with over 3 million creators.I have a question about the plan Iâm on â who should I contact?With any questions about your plan, tech support, or onboarding, please email [email protected] and our team will be in touch. If you need quick help on how to build and manage your Flowcodes, please head to our blog.
