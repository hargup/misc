This thing drove me from Prague to Belgrade and back without issues. It can keep you in lanes almost all the time, change lanes, adapt the speed, stop & go in the traffic. It runs opensource openpilot which gets better every month.FEB 26, 2023@JFreceesI can honestly say the C3 is the single best purchase I’ve ever made. I can’t imagine driving without it nowMar 17, 2022@jma22576Openpilot is better and far cheaper. Plus it works in way more cars. Assisted driving, for those of us that have used it, is much more relaxing. Especially on long drives over 3-4 hours. I love driving. But I feel more alert and rested when using assisted driving on long hauls.MAR 7, 2023@wesley_shehThe most impactful thing to come out of AI for me is not ChatGPT.It's another little-known product that I've been using for a year and a half now. (They do no marketing whatsoever)‍It's @comma_ai and if it supports your car, buy it. It is well worth it.MAR 31, 2023@mavlonodotI've been using openpilot for about 3 months now. Probably one of the best purchase decisions I've ever made. Great work @comma_ai team and @realGeorgeHotzJan 18, 2021@ngianoplusI have logged 3,780 miles with Openpilot engaged. Since I've had a Comma Two installed in my car, I have driven about 3,982 miles. This means my Openpilot engagement rate is 94.9%Now if we go by total miles driven since OWNING the car, the rate is (3780/5800 miles) = 65%Feb 18, 2021@tesla4kdrove 2+ hrs with @comma_ai Comma 2 w/OpenPilot in our 2017 Subaru Impreza.Fascinating that a team of ~12 is able leverage available sensor suite that comes with almost any modern(2016+) car and make it better than the stock driver assist using a 2016 cellphone (LeEco LePro 3).Jul 3, 2021@OttogiBeefCurryCurrently on a road trip. Leaving I had a choice of the Model Y or my minivan. Space wasn't an issue, so I was leaning toward the Y for reliability. I ended up taking the van though. The deciding factor was that comma ai is just so much better for long highway drives.JUL 25, 2023@llckllJust came home from a 14 hour round trip to Disney and back. @comma_ai #CommaThree #OpenPilot0813 drove 99.5% hands free!!! Maybe 1 or 2 disengagements on my end. @realGeorgeHotz @aalleexx5,335 viewsFeb 21, 2022@Traveller200xI don't need a Tesla. I have OpenPilot, by @comma_ai.
