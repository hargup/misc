in over 120,000 reviewsSlide 1 of 17âThe biggest benefit I received from Crimson was developing a successful strategy for grades 11 and 12. My Strategist and I would regularly meet to develop and strengthen my extracurriculars, discuss my essays, and provide me with a general timeline and list of tasks I should aim for to complete.â

Aryan C.
Harvard University, Class of 2026âBefore finding Crimson, I was really overwhelmed. I was listing out all
the essays I had to write and thought âthis is too much.â I had no idea how to even get started. Through Crimson, I was able to see which steps I should take that were manageable, and my team provided me with a lot of strength and courage to keep going.â

Kristin J.
Princeton University, Class of 2026âIt really helped to have someone experienced reviewing your application. I imagine that someone whoâs read hundreds and hundreds of applications has a very good idea of what works and what doesnât.â

Nicholas C.
Harvard University, Class of 2026âWhen I first started this process I had no idea I would be accepted to Harvard and to Oxford. Crimsonâs counselors helped me with both my US and UK applications. There was nothing they did not know.â

Lina C.
Harvard University, Class of 2023âCrimsonâs support was fundamental to my acceptance to such a competitive university. I am at Stanford because of the support of my Crimson college counselors, and for that I am so grateful.â

Lara F.
Stanford University, Class of 2023âThe biggest lesson I have learned through the application process is that one can never achieve great things without other peopleâs support. If it were not for my family, teachers, friends and my incredible Crimson team who supported me for the past three years, I would not be standing where I am.â

Ken T.
Columbia University, Class of 2025"A family friend recommended Crimson, based on their positive personal experience and Crimsonâs counselors helped me with things that I didn't even know I needed help with! They were simply amazing.â

Talia S.
Brown University, Class of 2024âI would recommend Crimson to any student who has ambitious goals and a hard-working mindset. Crimson knows exactly how to help you build the strongest application possible.â

Emma T.
University of CambridgeâMy counselor Dylan was an incredible help â not just regarding the advice he gave for my common application. Heâs at Princeton, and is studying the same things I plan on studying."

Seyoon R.
Princeton University, Class of 2021âI know Crimson have the information and their tutors and counselors are the best. But the fact that they get so invested, that they give you such peace of mind â that was just incredible.â

Josh M.
Stanford University, Class of 2024âI think compared to many students who are very stressed, I had a very nice application process. Thanks to the support and encouragement of my Crimson team I actually enjoyed the whole process.â

Takenoshin Y.
Yale University, Class of 2025âWhen it came to my Crimson team, I was surrounded by Oxbridge alumni! Four of my counselors studied at Oxford and my Crimson history tutor studied at Cambridge. Out of the six people on my team, five of them had studied at Oxford or Cambridge. Having that kind of access and being able to connect with such successful people was amazing.â

Michael V.
University of OxfordâMy sonâs Crimson team was well organized. He had counselors who were motivating, supportive and very helpful. They were all experienced and knowledgeable and their organisation was outrageously good!â

Crimson parentâThere are no words to describe the support that Crimson provided to my daughter. Her offers from Stanford and a number of Ivy League schools were testament to their care and knowledge."

Crimson parentâCrimson helped my child tremendously. My sonâs counseling team was endlessly reliable, and the quality of work ethic was top notch across the entire group."

Crimson parentâAt Crimson, you have support from counselors that have had hands-on experience. Their professionalism, organisational ability and dedicated planning made the process clear and doable.â

Crimson parentâEveryone at Crimson is very helpful and kind. We are glad we contacted Crimson. Theyâre breadth of college admissions information is limitless. They have been very, very useful in this process.â
