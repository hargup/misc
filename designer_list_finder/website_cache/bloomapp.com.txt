I'm 19, so the app setup is super helpful. It is set up in a simple way that allows me to really familiarize myself with stocks. The lessons are intriguing but provide great information! It is a great program and very helpful. I highly recommend for people genuinely interested and dedicated to learning about the stock market. Ben A. M.February 23, 2023AMAZING!!This app is not only a investment app to place money but it also gives you a good insight on investing too. The app is really organized and easy to find different things, and it's easy to start. The app has things called Oinks which you can use to join giveaways or get stocks. Overall it's a 10/10 recommendation.OreoCookies1February 7, 2023Amazing education, great support, worth the priceI purchased Bloom for my childâs 13th birthday and sheâs loved it! Weâve been going through the lessons together and theyâre easy to understand while still being useful. Iâve learned some interesting things from the video lessons with CEOs! The app bans day trading and has good parental controls, so I feel very safe with letting my teen invest. I initially approved each order, but now I just have some risk ratings setup. Also, great support experience! My teen texts with the team whenever she has questions and they always get to us quickly.Penguin master ð§December 20, 2022Exciting financial future and closer relationship thanks to BloomWhen my 14 year old daughter asked me to help her begin to invest using your platform I was delighted to see that there was something for her age but I had no idea how much it would teach her about investing. I am so impressed with the lessons that she has completed and how much she is really starting to learn about investing. Another unexpected benefit of using your service is the way our relationship has grown closer. We have so much fun texting each other back and forth as we are monitoring our portfolios each day. Thanks to Bloom she is well on her way to an exciting financial future.KevinMay 10, 2023Great educational toolMy 17-year old son asked me to help him set up a Bloom account after learning about it at school. I looked into the app and decided to give it a try. The app has really sparked his interest in financial literacy and investing. He is actually looking into majoring in business with a focus in financial planning, and he is loving the educational modules in the app. Highly recommended!MountaineermacMay 10, 202214 year old really learning about investing!So far, we are really happy with this app. My son really likes the interface, and he's learning quite a bit about investing, which is great!
