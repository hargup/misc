Maybe that’s making partner, leading an in-house legal team, or leveraging your legal expertise to start your own company.Only to discover that:Even though you have a powerful vision, no one trained you to be a leaderThe fear of getting it wrong and second-guessing is holding you backYou’re done with sacrificing health, happiness & your loved ones to manage your workMaybe you’ve tried listening to podcasts and reading books. But there’s no one there to show you your blind spots and hold you accountable.Maybe you’ve worked with a coach. But they don’t have the legal background and depth of experience necessary to understand and help you.Client backgroundsWhat makes me different?Here's a little about why I I'm different:Spent 7 years at a top-tier law firmWon awards as a lawyer and made partner before I was 30Built my own employment law departmentHave a mindset of innovation & I’m here to support the global legal sector with transformationAm an accredited ICF leadership and performance coachI get it. The highs, the lows, the old ways of doing things, and everything in between.The stress, the weight of responsibility, the grind. But also the indescribable satisfaction when you get things right.I’ve helped legal professionals at Netflix, Google, Apple, Linkedin, Baker Mckenzie, DLA Piper, & Cooley break old, ineffective habits and find peace of mind, greater physical well-being, and time to dedicate to the things and people that matter to them.Client appreciationCharlotte’s coaching program delivered everything it promised and far more.The process had a wide ranging positive effect on every single aspect of my life and the impact of the shift in my mindset and behaviours continues to deliver benefits for me across both personally and professionally.I am able to do so much more with the time I have available to me, and I feel extremely satisfied with the changes that have been brought about as a result of undertaking this personal development.Charlotte is extremely approachable and guides you through in a considered and effective way without pressure or judgment. I cannot recommend this investment in yourself highly enough.Kylie RobertsLawyer, Global Director UKRecently I’ve experienced the super powers of  Charlotte with a tailored group energy awareness session!
