I listed the business on Flippa, and one of the big names in the industry recognised the brand… They wouldn’t have known the business was for sale. Flippa was the catalyst.

We acquired a top-tier content site for mid-seven figures, and Flippa made the process seamless. The advisory team were exceptional through the process. We look forward to future transactions with Flippa.

Flippa went along with us on the journey. They’re a partner in the sale and we loved that. As a founder, you’re really close to it and you think you have to be making millions before anyone would be interested but that’s not the case.

Life changing site. I sold for $550,000. It gave me what I wanted, volume. I was able to leverage competing offers. Flippa gave me the career path I didn’t know existed. It’s been a game changer for me.
