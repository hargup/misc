FAQ 




 




Hey, if we're going to build a relationship together in you trusting us to handle your valuable feedback data, it's good to be transparent up-front, right? Let's look at some of the most common questions. 










How can I share it with users?

You can share the link to your Upvoty feedback portal, or, you can embed the roadmap and/or feedback boards in your own site or application to make it even more seamless.







Do my users need to sign up?

Yes and no. By default, we ask users to sign up via email or social login (Twitter, Facebook, or Google). However, you can either enable anonymous-mode, which lets users participate without an account, or, setup User SSO on your end so they will be automatically authenticated and logged in with their existing account from your application.







Can I use it both internally and publicly?

Yes, each board can be setup privately or publicly. You can use it for you and your team internally, share it with specific user groups, or with everyone in public.







How do you handle data?

Our servers are based in the Netherlands (Europe) under strict GDPR rules. Your data is absolutely safe as we host everything ourselves and we do not use any third party integrations (except for our payment processes, we use Stripe for that).







Can I customize?

Yes, you can change all of the colors and contents. We even have custom CSS available.







Do you have whitelabel?

Yes, you can enable whitelabel on our UNLIMITED plan. This will remove all Upvoty branding.
